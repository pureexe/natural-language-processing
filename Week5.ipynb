      "\r\n",
      "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\r\n",
      "the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\r\n",
      "in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\r\n",
      "garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\r\n",
      "like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\r\n",
      "dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\r\n",
      "he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\r\n",
      "invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\r\n",
      "sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\r\n",
      "hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\r\n",
      "for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\r\n",
      "verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\r\n",
      "himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\r\n",
      "only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\r\n",
      "anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\r\n",
      "given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\r\n",
      "desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\r\n",
      "for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\r\n",
      "trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\r\n",
      "and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\r\n",
      "lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\r\n",
      "slip out unseen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\r\n",
      "aware of his fears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\r\n",
      "trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\r\n",
      "hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\r\n",
      "be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\r\n",
      "step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\r\n",
      "too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\r\n",
      "that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\r\n",
      "last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\r\n",
      "Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\r\n",
      "_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\r\n",
      "myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\r\n",
      "and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\r\n",
      "special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\r\n",
      "of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\r\n",
      "overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\r\n",
      "are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\r\n",
      "whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\r\n",
      "the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\r\n",
      "disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\r\n",
      "by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\r\n",
      "well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\r\n",
      "into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\r\n",
      "of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\r\n",
      "to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\r\n",
      "habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\r\n",
      "moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\r\n",
      "tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\r\n",
      "food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\r\n",
      "have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\r\n",
      "of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\r\n",
      "created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\r\n",
      "of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\r\n",
      "and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\r\n",
      "heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\r\n",
      "that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\r\n",
      "such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\r\n",
      "in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\r\n",
      "of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\r\n",
      "acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\r\n",
      "meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\r\n",
      "reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\r\n",
      "dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\r\n",
      "hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\r\n",
      "man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\r\n",
      "round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\r\n",
      "torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\r\n",
      "fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\r\n",
      "had overtaken him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\r\n",
      "of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\r\n",
      "spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\r\n",
      "and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\r\n",
      "sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\r\n",
      "a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\r\n",
      "matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\r\n",
      "a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\r\n",
      "possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\r\n",
      "trifles that always ruin everything....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\r\n",
      "of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\r\n",
      "them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\r\n",
      "faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\r\n",
      "but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\r\n",
      "them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\r\n",
      "his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\r\n",
      "this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\r\n",
      "still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\r\n",
      "“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\r\n",
      "and more violent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\r\n",
      "which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\r\n",
      "street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\r\n",
      "working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\r\n",
      "sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\r\n",
      "There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\r\n",
      "two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\r\n",
      "the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\r\n",
      "at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\r\n",
      "staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\r\n",
      "with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\r\n",
      "in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\r\n",
      "I were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\r\n",
      "reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\r\n",
      "who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\r\n",
      "flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\r\n",
      "family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\r\n",
      "staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\r\n",
      "thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\r\n",
      "woman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\r\n",
      "tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\r\n",
      "that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\r\n",
      "its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\r\n",
      "clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\r\n",
      "by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\r\n",
      "woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\r\n",
      "nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\r\n",
      "But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\r\n",
      "opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\r\n",
      "was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\r\n",
      "him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\r\n",
      "withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\r\n",
      "little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\r\n",
      "with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\r\n",
      "which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\r\n",
      "and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\r\n",
      "fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\r\n",
      "instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\r\n",
      "expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\r\n",
      "haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\r\n",
      "polite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\r\n",
      "old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\r\n",
      "little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\r\n",
      "she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\r\n",
      "time,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\r\n",
      "and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\r\n",
      "in front of her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Step in, my good sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\r\n",
      "the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\r\n",
      "lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\r\n",
      "chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\r\n",
      "everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\r\n",
      "remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\r\n",
      "furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\r\n",
      "a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\r\n",
      "dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\r\n",
      "chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\r\n",
      "frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\r\n",
      "all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\r\n",
      "was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\r\n",
      "everything shone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\r\n",
      "to be seen in the whole flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\r\n",
      "cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\r\n",
      "at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\r\n",
      "which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\r\n",
      "had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\r\n",
      "and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\r\n",
      "the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\r\n",
      "an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\r\n",
      "globe; the chain was of steel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\r\n",
      "your pledge at once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\r\n",
      "I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\r\n",
      "quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\r\n",
      "shall be getting some money soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\r\n",
      "young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\r\n",
      "away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\r\n",
      "else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\r\n",
      "the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\r\n",
      "the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\r\n",
      "her unlocking the chest of drawers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\r\n",
      "a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\r\n",
      "one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\r\n",
      "that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\r\n",
      "other chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\r\n",
      "have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman came back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\r\n",
      "on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\r\n",

      "or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\r\n",
      "in the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\r\n",
      "can I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\r\n",
      "resolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\r\n",
      "What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\r\n",
      "disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\r\n",
      " But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\r\n",
      "of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\r\n",
      "while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\r\n",
      "pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\r\n",
      "do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\r\n",
      "pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\r\n",
      "against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\r\n",
      "street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\r\n",
      "which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\r\n",
      "At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\r\n",
      "supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\r\n",
      "think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\r\n",
      "never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\r\n",
      "burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\r\n",
      "sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\r\n",
      "table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\r\n",
      "off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\r\n",
      "clear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\r\n",
      "all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\r\n",
      "beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\r\n",
      "the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\r\n",
      "is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\r\n",
      "as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\r\n",
      "round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\r\n",
      "moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\r\n",
      "not normal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\r\n",
      "men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\r\n",
      "a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\r\n",
      "left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\r\n",
      "were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\r\n",
      "sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\r\n",
      "a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\r\n",
      "dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\r\n",
      "his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\r\n",
      "part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\r\n",
      "meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\r\n",

      "positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\r\n",
      "another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\r\n",
      "clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\r\n",
      "society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\r\n",
      "felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\r\n",
      "place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\r\n",
      "was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\r\n",
      "excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\r\n",
      "world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\r\n",
      "surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\r\n",
      "came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\r\n",
      "red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\r\n",
      "person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\r\n",
      "with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\r\n",
      "iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\r\n",
      "another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\r\n",
      "counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\r\n",
      "some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\r\n",
      "close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\r\n",
      "an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\r\n",
      "first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\r\n",
      "like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\r\n",
      "afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\r\n",
      "at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\r\n",
      "persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\r\n",
      "the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\r\n",
      "looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\r\n",
      "a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\r\n",
      "culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\r\n",
      "converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\r\n",
      "and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\r\n",
      "a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\r\n",
      "reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\r\n",
      "strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\r\n",
      "feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\r\n",
      "same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\r\n",
      "old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\r\n",
      "except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\r\n",
      "last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\r\n",
      "and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\r\n",
      "no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\r\n",
      "looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\r\n",
      "and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\r\n",
      "ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\r\n",
      "hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\r\n",
      "table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\r\n",
      "resolutely:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\r\n",
      "Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\r\n",
      "experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\r\n",
      "accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\r\n",
      "conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\r\n",
      "counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\r\n",
      "make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\r\n",
      "the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\r\n",
      "addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\r\n",
      "company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\r\n",
      "habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\r\n",
      "or attempted to approach him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\r\n",
      "I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\r\n",
      "tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\r\n",
      "student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\r\n",
      " He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\r\n",
      "the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\r\n",
      "fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\r\n",
      "sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\r\n",
      "greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\r\n",
      "that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\r\n",
      "and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\r\n",
      "vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\r\n",
      "in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\r\n",
      "society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\r\n",
      "humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\r\n",
      "I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\r\n",
      "Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\r\n",
      "my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\r\n",
      "to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\r\n",
      "a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\r\n",
      "so....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\r\n",
      "fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\r\n",
      "probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\r\n",
      "His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\r\n",
      "nails.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\r\n",
      "boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\r\n",
      "upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\r\n",
      " and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\r\n",
      "Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\r\n",
      "likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\r\n",
      "frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\r\n",
      "the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\r\n",
      "especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\r\n",
      "at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\r\n",
      "themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\r\n",
      "aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\r\n",
      "himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\r\n",
      "that question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\r\n",
      "to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\r\n",
      "beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\r\n",
      "Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\r\n",
      "petition hopelessly for a loan?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\r\n",
      "will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\r\n",
      "certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\r\n",
      "on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\r\n",
      "For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\r\n",
      "Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\r\n",
      "that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\r\n",
      "what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\r\n",
      "ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\r\n",
      "he won’t, I set off to him and...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\r\n",
      "have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\r\n",
      "go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\r\n",
      "then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\r\n",
      "in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\r\n",
      "“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\r\n",
      "composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\r\n",
      "innkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\r\n",
      "their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\r\n",
      "that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\r\n",
      "with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\r\n",
      "man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\r\n",
      "_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man did not answer a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\r\n",
      "after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\r\n",
      "it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\r\n",
      "daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\r\n",
      "noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\r\n",
      "if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\r\n",
      "ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\r\n",
      "I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\r\n",
      "I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\r\n",
      "declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\r\n",
      "God, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\r\n",
      "use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\r\n",
      "and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\r\n",
      "beast by nature!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\r\n",
      "resolutely on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\r\n",
      "stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\r\n",
      "order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\r\n",
      "Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\r\n",
      "property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\r\n",
      "winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\r\n",
      "little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\n",
      "night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\r\n",
      "been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\r\n",
      "a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\r\n",
      "And the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\r\n",
      "to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\r\n",
      "twice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\r\n",
      "table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\r\n",
      "read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\r\n",
      "I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\r\n",
      "do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\r\n",
      "who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\r\n",
      "of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\r\n",
      "high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\r\n",
      "danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\r\n",
      "which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\r\n",
      "The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\r\n",
      "certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\r\n",
      "it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\r\n",
      "with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\r\n",
      "honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\r\n",
      "it, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\r\n",
      "the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\r\n",
      "of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\r\n",
      "nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\r\n",
      "with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\r\n",
      "rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\r\n",
      "her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\r\n",
      "a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\r\n",
      "other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\r\n",
      "ran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\r\n",
      "her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\r\n",
      "died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\r\n",
      "which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\r\n",
      "him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\r\n",
      "that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\r\n",
      "once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\r\n",
      "a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\r\n",
      "was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\r\n",
      "and downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\r\n",
      "relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\r\n",
      "proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\r\n",
      "widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\r\n",
      "her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\r\n",
      "judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\r\n",
      "and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\r\n",
      "wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\r\n",
      "married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\r\n",
      "understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\r\n",
      "that you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\r\n",
      "my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\r\n",
      "tapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\r\n",
      "could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\r\n",
      "fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\r\n",
      "it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\r\n",
      "last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\r\n",
      "capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\r\n",
      "situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\r\n",
      "time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\r\n",
      "out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\r\n",
      "and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\r\n",
      "There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\r\n",
      "disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\r\n",
      "my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\r\n",
      "from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\r\n",
      "though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\n",
      "lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\r\n",
      "that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\r\n",
      "effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\r\n",
      "history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\r\n",
      "had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\r\n",
      "even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\r\n",
      "Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\r\n",
      "other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\r\n",
      "interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\r\n",
      "you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\r\n",
      "whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\r\n",
      "sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\r\n",
      "a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\r\n",
      "farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\r\n",
      "talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\r\n",
      "more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\r\n",
      "him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\r\n",
      "made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\r\n",
      "pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\r\n",
      "put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\r\n",
      "red, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\r\n",
      "she, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\r\n",
      "And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\r\n",
      "little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\r\n",
      "it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\r\n",
      "creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\r\n",
      "little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\r\n",
      "like that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\r\n",
      "well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\r\n",
      "through the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n",
      "‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\r\n",
      "her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\r\n",
      "when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\n",
      "of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\n",
      "else.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\r\n",
      "cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\r\n",
      "I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\r\n",
      "room and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\r\n",
      "in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\n",
      "simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\n",
      "made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\n",
      "on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\n",
      "body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\n",
      "And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\n",
      "go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\n",
      "kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\n",
      "asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\n",
      "drunk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\r\n",
      "hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\r\n",
      "to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\r\n",
      "evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\r\n",
      "leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\r\n",
      "respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\r\n",
      "a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\r\n",
      "us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\n",
      "she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\n",
      "hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\r\n",
      "account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\r\n",
      "a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\r\n",
      "man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\r\n",
      "how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\n",
      "comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\n",
      "at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\r\n",
      "a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\r\n",
      "palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\r\n",
      "room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\r\n",
      "people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\r\n",
      "and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\r\n",
      "excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\r\n",
      "know him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\r\n",
      "wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\r\n",
      "dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\r\n",
      "deceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\r\n",
      "responsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\r\n",
      "can go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\r\n",
      "he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\r\n",
      "modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\r\n",
      "announced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\r\n",
      "salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\r\n",
      "party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\r\n",
      "of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\r\n",
      "singing “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\r\n",
      "noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\r\n",
      "Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\r\n",
      "He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\r\n",
      "drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\r\n",
      "recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\r\n",
      "positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "listened attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\n",
      "kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\r\n",
      "abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\r\n",
      "They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\r\n",
      "began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\r\n",
      "to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\r\n",
      "copecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\r\n",
      "a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\r\n",
      "a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\r\n",
      "horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\r\n",
      "dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\r\n",
      "on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\r\n",
      "herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\r\n",
      "clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\r\n",
      "person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\r\n",
      "had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\r\n",
      "to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\r\n",
      "you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\r\n",
      "think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\r\n",
      "our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\r\n",
      "resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\r\n",
      "whispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\r\n",
      "now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\r\n",
      "excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\r\n",
      "others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\r\n",
      "his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\r\n",
      "of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\r\n",
      "since moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\r\n",
      "hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\r\n",
      "all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\r\n",
      "simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\r\n",
      "all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\r\n",
      "does! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\r\n",
      "ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\r\n",
      "forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\r\n",
      "‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\r\n",
      "You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\r\n",
      "husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\r\n",
      "said she.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\r\n",
      "to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\r\n",
      "appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\r\n",
      "spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\r\n",
      "his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\r\n",
      "He felt vexed that he had come here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,\r\n",
      "sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\r\n",
      "others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\r\n",
      "trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\r\n",
      "For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\r\n",
      "and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\r\n",
      "arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\r\n",
      "give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\r\n",
      "and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\r\n",
      "Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\r\n",
      "of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\r\n",
      "the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\r\n",
      "days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\r\n",
      "I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\r\n",
      "left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\r\n",
      "at me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\r\n",
      "looking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform\r\n",
      "is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\r\n",
      "his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\r\n",
      "later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\r\n",
      "affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\r\n",
      "He-he-he!”\r\n",

      "“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\r\n",
      "shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\r\n",
      "addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\r\n",
      "me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\r\n",
      "nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\r\n",
      "yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\r\n",
      "they don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\r\n",
      "blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\r\n",
      "you think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\r\n",
      "costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\r\n",
      "understand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\r\n",
      "petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\r\n",
      "foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\r\n",
      "understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\r\n",
      "here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\r\n",
      "it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\r\n",
      "me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\r\n",
      "or not? He-he-he!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\r\n",
      "empty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\r\n",
      "near them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\r\n",

      "government clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\r\n",

      "waiting for that question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\r\n",

      "oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\r\n",
      "crucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\r\n",
      "Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\r\n",
      "sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\r\n",
      "tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\r\n",
      "us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\r\n",
      "things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\r\n",
      "and He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\r\n",
      "consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\r\n",
      "the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\r\n",
      "undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\r\n",
      "already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\r\n",
      "which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\r\n",
      "will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\r\n",
      "heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\r\n",
      "all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\r\n",
      "done with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\r\n",
      "He will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\r\n",
      "forth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\r\n",
      "and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\r\n",
      "in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\r\n",
      "wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\r\n",
      "receive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\r\n",
      "wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\r\n",
      "of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\r\n",
      "hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\r\n",
      "and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\r\n",
      "all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\r\n",
      "Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\r\n",
      "helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\r\n",
      "and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\r\n",
      "there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",

      "rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\r\n",
      "close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\r\n",
      "curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\r\n",
      "stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\r\n",

      "over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\r\n",

      "dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\r\n",
      "face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\r\n",
      "door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\r\n",
      "facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\r\n",
      "he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\r\n",

      "“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\r\n",
      "positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\r\n",
      "fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\r\n",

      "Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\r\n",
      "to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\r\n",
      "outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\r\n",
      "way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\r\n",
      "for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\r\n",

      "refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\r\n",
      "with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\r\n",
      "paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\r\n",
      "yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\r\n",
      "of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\r\n",
      "that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\r\n",
      "keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\r\n",
      "painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\r\n",
      "the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\r\n",
      "untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\r\n",
      "half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\r\n",
      "was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\r\n",

      "student’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\r\n",

      "sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\r\n",
      "in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\r\n",
      "upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\r\n",
      "him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\r\n",
      "though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\r\n",
      "was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\r\n",
      "sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\r\n",

      "ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\r\n",

      "deal to put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\r\n",

      "the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\r\n",
      "let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\r\n",
      "do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\r\n",
      "made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\r\n",
      "in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\r\n",
      "condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\r\n",
      "was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\r\n",
      "This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\n",
      "chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\n",
      "then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\r\n",
      "writing that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\r\n",
      "so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\r\n",
      "suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\r\n",
      "you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\r\n",
      "her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\r\n",
      "table.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\r\n",
      "not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\r\n",
      "of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\r\n",
      "wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\r\n",
      "especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\r\n",
      "habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\r\n",
      "was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\r\n",
      "conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\r\n",
      "it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\r\n",
      "horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\r\n",
      "his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\r\n",
      "And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\r\n",
      "the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\n",
      "to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\n",
      "inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\n",
      "to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\r\n",
      "through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\n",
      "account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\n",
      "would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\r\n",
      "have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\n",
      "inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\n",
      "not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\n",
      "Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\n",
      "has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\n",
      "she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\r\n",
      "to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\r\n",
      "constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\n",
      "garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\n",
      "the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\r\n",
      "scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\n",
      "shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\n",
      "be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\r\n",
      "flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\n",
      "folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\n",
      "and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\n",
      "open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\r\n",
      "could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\r\n",
      "what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\r\n",
      "you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\r\n",
      "and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\r\n",
      "yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\r\n",
      "with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\r\n",
      "whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\r\n",
      "to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\r\n",
      "of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\r\n",
      "us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\r\n",
      "street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\r\n",
      "insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\r\n",
      "so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\r\n",
      "going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\r\n",
      "her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\r\n",
      "month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\r\n",
      "rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\r\n",
      "particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\r\n",
      "at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\r\n",
      "the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\r\n",
      "Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\r\n",
      "she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\r\n",
      "an angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\r\n",
      "feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\r\n",
      "unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\r\n",
      "had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\r\n",
      "personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\r\n",
      "her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\r\n",
      "for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\r\n",
      "him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\r\n",
      "infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\r\n",
      "unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\n",
      "touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\n",
      "read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\r\n",
      "cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\r\n",
      "than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\r\n",
      "with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\r\n",
      "crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\r\n",
      "Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\r\n",
      "to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\r\n",
      "her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\r\n",
      "came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\r\n",
      "bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\r\n",
      "forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\r\n",
      "the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\r\n",
      "the most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\r\n",
      "her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\n",
      "everyone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\r\n",
      "even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\r\n",
      "superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\n",
      "the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\n",
      "having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\r\n",
      "that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\r\n",
      "knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\r\n",
      "letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\r\n",
      "of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\r\n",
      "own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\r\n",
      "great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\r\n",
      "character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\r\n",
      "reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\r\n",
      "disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\r\n",
      "began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\r\n",
      "harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\r\n",
      "but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\r\n",
      "respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\r\n",
      "say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\r\n",
      "that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\n",
      "him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\r\n",
      "arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\r\n",
      "with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\r\n",
      "could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\r\n",
      "could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\r\n",
      "was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\r\n",
      "has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\r\n",
      "expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\r\n",
      "properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\r\n",
      "us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\r\n",
      "speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\r\n",
      "to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\r\n",
      "of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\r\n",
      "and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\r\n",
      "well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\r\n",
      "and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\r\n",
      "old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\r\n",
      "thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\r\n",
      "presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\r\n",
      "But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\r\n",
      "And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\n",
      "do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\n",
      "there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\r\n",
      "warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\r\n",
      "upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\n",
      "deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\n",
      "which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\r\n",
      "At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\r\n",
      "still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\r\n",
      "most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\r\n",
      "said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\r\n",
      "listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\r\n",
      "little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\r\n",
      "of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\r\n",
      "your sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\r\n",
      "generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\r\n",
      "Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\r\n",
      "it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\r\n",
      "happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\r\n",
      "must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\r\n",
      "is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\r\n",
      "his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\r\n",
      "him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\r\n",
      "certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\r\n",
      "the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\r\n",
      "relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\r\n",
      "that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\r\n",
      "relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\r\n",
      "for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\r\n",
      "from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\n",
      "instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\r\n",
      "in the course of conversation, he declared that before making\r\n",
      "Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\r\n",
      "good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\r\n",
      "poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\r\n",
      "wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\r\n",
      "benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\r\n",
      "than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\r\n",
      "remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\r\n",
      "but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\r\n",
      "to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\r\n",
      "me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\r\n",
      "vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\r\n",
      "perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\r\n",
      "her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\r\n",
      "walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\r\n",
      "the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\r\n",
      "that she had decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\r\n",
      "Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\r\n",
      "a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\r\n",
      "and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\r\n",
      "case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\r\n",
      "the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\n",
      "every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\n",
      "you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\n",
      "your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\r\n",
      "pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\r\n",
      "providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\r\n",
      "ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\r\n",
      "get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\r\n",
      "a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\r\n",
      "duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\r\n",
      "he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\r\n",
      "you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\r\n",
      "for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\r\n",
      "your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\r\n",
      "student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\n",
      "all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\n",
      "realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\r\n",
      "natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\r\n",
      "persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\r\n",
      "future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\r\n",
      "not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\r\n",
      "take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\r\n",
      "has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\r\n",
      "of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\r\n",
      "of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\r\n",
      "later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\r\n",
      "himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\r\n",
      "you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\r\n",
      "receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\r\n",
      "own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\r\n",
      "with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\r\n",
      "is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\r\n",
      "you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\r\n",
      "you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\r\n",
      "him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\r\n",
      "opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\r\n",
      "Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\r\n",
      "fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\r\n",
      "them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\r\n",
      "delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\r\n",
      "for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\r\n",
      "simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\r\n",
      "noticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\r\n",
      "their mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\r\n",
      "way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\r\n",
      "long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\r\n",
      "Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\n",
      "joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\n",
      "know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\n",
      "very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\n",
      "almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\r\n",
      "set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\r\n",
      "possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\r\n",
      "know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\r\n",
      "own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\r\n",
      "even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\r\n",
      "too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\r\n",
      "press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\r\n",
      "of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\r\n",
      "anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\r\n",
      "so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\r\n",
      "a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\r\n",
      "herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\r\n",
      "although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\r\n",
      "money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\r\n",
      "is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\r\n",
      "that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\r\n",
      "on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\r\n",
      "you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\r\n",
      "uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\r\n",
      "been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\r\n",
      "is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\r\n",
      "trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\r\n",
      "must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\r\n",
      "can’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\r\n",
      "we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\r\n",
      "that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\r\n",
      "us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\r\n",
      "know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\r\n",
      "quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\r\n",
      "to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\r\n",
      "two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\r\n",
      "history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\r\n",
      "I embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\r\n",
      "your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\r\n",
      "loves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\r\n",

      "reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\r\n",
      "intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\r\n",
      "strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\r\n",
      "quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\r\n",
      "no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\r\n",
      "on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\r\n",
      "properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\r\n",
      "waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\r\n",
      "flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\r\n",
      "walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\r\n",
      "drew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\r\n",
      "seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\r\n",
      "she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\r\n",
      "apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\r\n",
      "that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\r\n",
      "could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\r\n",
      "face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\r\n",
      "fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\r\n",
      "and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\r\n",
      "doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\r\n",
      "showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\r\n",

      "his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\r\n",

      "man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\r\n",
      "moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\r\n",

      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How dare you, you low fellow!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\r\n",
      "reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\r\n",
      "himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\r\n",
      "police constable stood between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\r\n",
      "do you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\r\n",
      "rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\r\n",
      "soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\r\n",
      "“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he\r\n",
      "added, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\r\n",
      "There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\r\n",
      "professional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\r\n",
      "somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her\r\n",
      "out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\r\n",
      "the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\r\n",
      "not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;\r\n",
      "that’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I\r\n",
      "was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\r\n",
      "her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\r\n",
      "he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\r\n",
      "is in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\r\n",
      "him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\r\n",
      "is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\r\n",
      "is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\r\n",
      "keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\r\n",
      "understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\r\n",
      "examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a\r\n",
      "child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”\r\n",
      " he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary\r\n",
      "and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\r\n",
      "copecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\r\n",
      "only thing is to find out her address!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch\r\n",
      "you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\r\n",
      "you live?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more\r\n",
      "waved her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook\r\n",
      "his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\r\n",
      "did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\r\n",
      "seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in\r\n",
      "the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\r\n",
      "mercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been\r\n",
      "deceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\r\n",
      "Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\r\n",
      "gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\r\n",
      "She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her\r\n",
      "once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and\r\n",
      "refined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this\r\n",
      "scoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day what\r\n",
      "he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,\r\n",
      "and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and\r\n",
      "confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another\r\n",
      "ten paces away and again halted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,\r\n",
      "“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,\r\n",
      "missy!” he bent over her once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as\r\n",
      "though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the\r\n",
      "direction from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let\r\n",
      "me alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though\r\n",
      "staggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,\r\n",
      "keeping his eye on her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said\r\n",
      "resolutely, and he set off after them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a\r\n",
      "complete revulsion of feeling came over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter turned round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse\r\n",
      "himself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he\r\n",
      "walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a\r\n",
      "madman or something even worse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily\r\n",
      "when he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the other\r\n",
      "fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I\r\n",
      "want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let\r\n",
      "them devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give him\r\n",
      "twenty copecks? Were they mine?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\r\n",
      "the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\r\n",
      "to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\r\n",
      "altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\r\n",
      "anew....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\r\n",
      "sat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find\r\n",
      "out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and\r\n",
      "then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the\r\n",
      "Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be\r\n",
      "slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital\r\n",
      "directly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable\r\n",
      "mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...\r\n",
      "drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a\r\n",
      "wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen\r\n",
      "cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve all\r\n",
      "come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should\r\n",
      "be, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year\r\n",
      "go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\r\n",
      "chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\r\n",
      "they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said\r\n",
      "‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\r\n",
      "word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one\r\n",
      "of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for\r\n",
      "something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\r\n",
      "to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I\r\n",
      "remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin\r\n",
      "into my head just now? That’s curious.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\r\n",
      "university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\r\n",
      "the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\r\n",
      "not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\r\n",
      "him up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or\r\n",
      "conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\r\n",
      "and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\r\n",
      "and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\r\n",
      "he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\r\n",
      "to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\r\n",
      "development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\r\n",
      "interests were beneath him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\r\n",
      "communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\r\n",
      "terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\r\n",
      "youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\r\n",
      "dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\r\n",
      "understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\r\n",
      "though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\r\n",
      "appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\r\n",
      "sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\r\n",
      "One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\r\n",
      "a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\r\n",
      "powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\r\n",
      "too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\r\n",
      "Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\r\n",
      "it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\r\n",
      "could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\r\n",
      "very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\r\n",
      "one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\r\n",
      "money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\r\n",
      "declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\r\n",
      "the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\r\n",
      "university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\r\n",
      "might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\r\n",
      "not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\r\n",
      "know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\r\n",
      "but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\r\n",
      "he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\r\n",
      "him by, as he did not want to annoy him.\r\n",

      "work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,\r\n",
      "“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\r\n",
      "he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\r\n",
      "musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\r\n",
      "thought came into his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\r\n",
      "reached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,\r\n",

      "going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the\r\n",
      "seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\r\n",
      "but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\r\n",
      "in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\r\n",
      "month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\r\n",
      "shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\r\n",
      "began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\r\n",
      "the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\r\n",
      "attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\r\n",
      "brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\r\n",
      "he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\r\n",
      "was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\r\n",
      "out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\r\n",
      "islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\r\n",
      "eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\r\n",
      "and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\r\n",
      "no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\r\n",
      "irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\r\n",
      "villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\r\n",
      "in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\r\n",
      "and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\r\n",
      "attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\r\n",
      "luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\r\n",
      "with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\r\n",
      "his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\r\n",
      "thirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\r\n",
      "letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\r\n",
      "yesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\r\n",
      "soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\r\n",
      "He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\r\n",
      "was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\r\n",
      "pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\r\n",
      "while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\r\n",
      "though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\r\n",
      "a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\r\n",
      "Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\r\n",
      "into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\r\n",

      "In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\r\n",

      "so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\r\n",
      "so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\r\n",
      "Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\r\n",

      "walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\r\n",
      "was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\r\n",
      "indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\r\n",
      "memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\r\n",
      "even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\r\n",
      "blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\r\n",
      "garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\r\n",
      "feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\r\n",
      "There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\r\n",
      "hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\r\n",
      "figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\r\n",
      "father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\r\n",
      "became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\r\n",
      "winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\r\n",
      "right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\r\n",
      "church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\r\n",
      "times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\r\n",
      "memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\r\n",
      "seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\r\n",
      "table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\r\n",
      "the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\r\n",
      "ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s\r\n",
      "grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\r\n",
      "brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\r\n",

      "the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\r\n",
      "to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\r\n",
      "walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\r\n",
      "was holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\r\n",
      "peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\r\n",
      "some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\r\n",
      "townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\r\n",
      "all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\r\n",
      "stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\r\n",
      "drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\r\n",
      "goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\r\n",
      "long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\r\n",
      "mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\r\n",
      "with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\r\n",
      "such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’\r\n",
      "nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\r\n",
      "of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\r\n",
      "a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\r\n",
      "about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\r\n",
      "he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\r\n",
      "window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\r\n",
      "and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\r\n",
      "peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\r\n",
      "their shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\r\n",
      "a fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\r\n",
      "crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take us all with a beast like that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\r\n",
      "the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay\r\n",
      "has gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,\r\n",
      "is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just\r\n",
      "eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll\r\n",
      "gallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\r\n",
      "flog the little mare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’ll jog along!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right! Give it to her!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\r\n",
      "men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\r\n",
      "rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\r\n",
      "headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\r\n",
      "The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\r\n",
      "laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\r\n",
      "gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\r\n",
      "help Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,\r\n",
      "but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\r\n",
      "her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\r\n",
      "were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\r\n",
      "crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\r\n",
      "the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose\r\n",
      "appetite was aroused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat\r\n",
      "her to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\r\n",
      "with fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, they\r\n",
      "are beating the poor horse!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken and\r\n",
      "foolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw\r\n",
      "him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\r\n",
      "with horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was\r\n",
      "gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do for\r\n",
      "her!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man\r\n",
      "in the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a\r\n",
      "cartload,” said another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more of\r\n",
      "you! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,\r\n",
      "roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man\r\n",
      "could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that\r\n",
      "trying to kick!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her\r\n",
      "about the ribs. One ran each side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the\r\n",
      "cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The\r\n",
      "woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped\r\n",
      "across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his\r\n",
      "tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across\r\n",
      "the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he\r\n",
      "rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was\r\n",
      "shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\r\n",
      "would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\r\n",
      "the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down\r\n",
      "the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,\r\n",
      "thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort\r\n",
      "brandished it over the mare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a\r\n",
      "swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the\r\n",
      "crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time\r\n",
      "on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but\r\n",
      "lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\r\n",
      "one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\r\n",
      "whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\r\n",
      "again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\r\n",
      "blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said\r\n",
      "an admiring spectator in the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down\r\n",
      "the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look\r\n",
      "out,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\r\n",
      "poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,\r\n",
      "but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on\r\n",
      "the ground like a log.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\r\n",
      "the cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything\r\n",
      "they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying\r\n",
      "mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\r\n",
      "crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar\r\n",
      "in his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to\r\n",
      "beat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were\r\n",
      "shouting in the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the\r\n",
      "crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and\r\n",
      "kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and\r\n",
      "flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant\r\n",
      "his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\r\n",
      "him out of the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his\r\n",
      "voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his\r\n",
      "father. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He\r\n",
      "tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and\r\n",
      "stood up in terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree\r\n",
      "and drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?\r\n",
      "Such a hideous dream!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He\r\n",
      "rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an\r\n",
      "axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I\r\n",
      "shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\r\n",
      "hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it\r\n",
      "be?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it\r\n",
      "were in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself\r\n",
      "to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\r\n",
      "yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\r\n",
      "realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\r\n",
      "over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\r\n",
      "yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\r\n",
      "very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is\r\n",
      "no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last\r\n",
      "month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t\r\n",
      "bring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am\r\n",
      "I still...?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\r\n",
      "finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\r\n",
      "his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\r\n",
      "to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\r\n",
      "had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\r\n",
      "of relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I\r\n",
      "renounce that accursed... dream of mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\r\n",
      "glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\r\n",
      "was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\r\n",
      "forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\r\n",
      "freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\r\n",
      "those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\r\n",
      "impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\r\n",
      "exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\r\n",
      "turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\r\n",
      "himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\r\n",
      "more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\r\n",
      "he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\r\n",
      "obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\r\n",
      "is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\r\n",
      "noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\r\n",
      "himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\r\n",
      "such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\r\n",
      "had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\r\n",
      "life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\r\n",
      "in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\r\n",
      "influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\r\n",
      "him on purpose!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\r\n",
      "and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\r\n",
      "closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\r\n",
      "wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\r\n",
      "costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\r\n",
      "and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\r\n",
      "liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\r\n",
      "in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\r\n",
      "and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\r\n",
      "the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\r\n",
      "with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\r\n",
      "go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\r\n",
      "come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\r\n",
      "called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\r\n",
      "watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\r\n",
      "and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\r\n",
      "thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\r\n",
      "a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\r\n",
      "made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\r\n",
      "a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\r\n",
      "doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\r\n",
      "moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\r\n",
      "sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\r\n",
      "astonishing about this meeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the\r\n",
      "huckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will\r\n",
      "be here too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\r\n",
      "make up her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled\r\n",
      "the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like\r\n",

      "“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband\r\n",
      "interrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\r\n",
      "It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\r\n",
      "notion.”\r\n",

      "“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\r\n",
      "slowly moving away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\r\n",
      "unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\r\n",
      "by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\r\n",
      "learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\r\n",
      "seven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\r\n",
      "condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\r\n",
      "but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\r\n",
      "of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\r\n",
      "decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\r\n",
      "could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\r\n",
      "than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\r\n",
      "been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\r\n",
      "greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\r\n",
      "investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\r\n",

      "nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\r\n",
      "reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\r\n",

      "they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She\r\n",
      "undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\r\n",
      "and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\r\n",
      "little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\r\n",
      "superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\r\n",
      "And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\r\n",
      "strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\r\n",
      "influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\r\n",
      "called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\r\n",
      "give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\r\n",
      "might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\r\n",
      "he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\r\n",
      "remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\r\n",
      "father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\r\n",
      "a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\r\n",
      "he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\r\n",
      "at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\r\n",
      "two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\r\n",
      "home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\r\n",
      "idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\r\n",
      "much absorbed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\r\n",
      "did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\r\n",
      "played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\r\n",
      "the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\r\n",
      "give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\r\n",
      "had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\r\n",
      "it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\r\n",
      "impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\r\n",
      "the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is\r\n",
      "as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\r\n",
      "she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\r\n",
      "had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\r\n",
      "were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\r\n",
      "gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\r\n",
      "percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\r\n",
      "that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\r\n",
      "continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\r\n",
      "though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\r\n",
      "peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\r\n",
      "with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\r\n",
      "for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\r\n",
      "her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\r\n",
      "being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\r\n",
      "day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\r\n",
      "washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\r\n",
      "all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\r\n",
      "without her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her\r\n",
      "will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\r\n",
      "farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\r\n",
      "left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\r\n",
      "said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\r\n",
      "unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\r\n",
      "feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\r\n",
      "goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\r\n",
      "most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\r\n",
      "continually with child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\r\n",
      "you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\r\n",
      "and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\r\n",
      "attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\r\n",
      "with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\r\n",
      "really very sweet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\r\n",
      "old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\r\n",
      "faintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer\r\n",
      "laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.\r\n",
      "“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\r\n",
      "senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\r\n",
      "useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\r\n",
      "living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\r\n",
      "understand? You understand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited\r\n",
      "companion attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\r\n",
      "want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\r\n",
      "deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be\r\n",
      "buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\r\n",
      "right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\r\n",
      "vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\r\n",
      "her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\r\n",
      "humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\r\n",
      "crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\r\n",
      "would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\r\n",
      "in exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\r\n",
      "that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\r\n",
      "No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\r\n",
      "because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\r\n",
      "others; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost\r\n",
      "had to be amputated.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but\r\n",
      "there it is, it’s nature.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but\r\n",
      "for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\r\n",
      "there would never have been a single great man. They talk of\r\n",
      "duty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and\r\n",
      "conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have\r\n",
      "another question to ask you. Listen!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the\r\n",
      "old woman _yourself_?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to\r\n",
      "do with me....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about\r\n",
      "it.... Let us have another game.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary\r\n",
      "youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in\r\n",
      "different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear\r\n",
      "such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\r\n",
      "was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\r\n",
      "moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\r\n",
      "woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\r\n",
      "coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern\r\n",
      "had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had\r\n",
      "really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*****\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\r\n",
      "for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\r\n",
      "candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\r\n",
      "recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\r\n",
      "last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\r\n",
      "with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\r\n",
      "came over him, as it were crushing him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\r\n",
      "coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty\r\n",
      "in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\r\n",
      "second brew and again in her own tea-pot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always\r\n",
      "asleep.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\r\n",
      "his garret and sank back on the sofa again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you want some tea?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\r\n",
      "to the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya stood over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in\r\n",
      "again at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\r\n",
      "untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\r\n",
      "rousing him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with\r\n",
      "repulsion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\r\n",
      "“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.\r\n",
      "“Will you eat it or not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he motioned her out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\r\n",
      "at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\r\n",
      "began to eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\r\n",
      "mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\r\n",
      "on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\r\n",
      "with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\r\n",
      "strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\r\n",
      "in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\r\n",
      "the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\r\n",
      "complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\r\n",
      "from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\r\n",
      "wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\r\n",
      "stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\r\n",
      "gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\r\n",
      "raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\r\n",
      "suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\r\n",
      "sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\r\n",
      "listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\r\n",
      "on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\r\n",
      "monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\r\n",
      "previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\r\n",
      "meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\r\n",
      "were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\r\n",
      "haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\r\n",
      "energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\r\n",
      "kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\r\n",
      "to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\r\n",
      "rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\r\n",
      "under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\r\n",
      "strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\r\n",
      "this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\r\n",
      "stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\r\n",
      "ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\r\n",
      "as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\r\n",
      "when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\r\n",
      "long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\r\n",
      "noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\r\n",
      "for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\r\n",
      "street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\r\n",
      "had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\r\n",
      "he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\r\n",
      "quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\r\n",
      "pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\r\n",
      "not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\r\n",
      "could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\r\n",
      "hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\r\n",
      "fortnight before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\r\n",
      "between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\r\n",
      "the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\r\n",
      "pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\r\n",
      "thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\r\n",
      "in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\r\n",
      "a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\r\n",
      "of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\r\n",
      "Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\r\n",
      "he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\r\n",
      "them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\r\n",
      "tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\r\n",
      "was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\r\n",
      "she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\r\n",
      "was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\r\n",
      "minute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by\r\n",
      "him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\r\n",
      "he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It struck six long ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Long ago! My God!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\r\n",
      "his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\r\n",
      "most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\r\n",
      "deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\r\n",
      "pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\r\n",
      "on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\r\n",
      "passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\r\n",
      "him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\r\n",
      "they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\r\n",
      "his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\r\n",
      "a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\r\n",
      "plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\r\n",
      "could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\r\n",
      "any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\r\n",
      "as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\r\n",
      "unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\r\n",
      "that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\r\n",
      "Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\r\n",
      "she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\r\n",
      "door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\r\n",
      "about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\r\n",
      "the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\r\n",
      "was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\r\n",
      "Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\r\n",
      "come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\r\n",
      "till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\r\n",
      "the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\r\n",
      "least grounds for suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\r\n",
      "indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\r\n",
      "trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\r\n",
      "utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\r\n",
      "imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\r\n",
      "up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\r\n",
      "the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\r\n",
      "an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\r\n",
      "“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he\r\n",
      "had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\r\n",
      "analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\r\n",
      "could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\r\n",
      "he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\r\n",
      "arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\r\n",
      "forcing and drawing him to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\r\n",
      "question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\r\n",

      "of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\r\n",
      "criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\r\n",
      "childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\r\n",

      "developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the\r\n",
      "perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\r\n",

      "When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\r\n",
      "could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\r\n",
      "remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\r\n",
      "simple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the\r\n",
      "process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\r\n",
      "run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\r\n",
      "material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\r\n",
      "mind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal\r\n",
      "with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\r\n",
      "familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But\r\n",
      "this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\r\n",
      "came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\r\n",
      "differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\r\n",
      "left the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door\r\n",
      "of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\r\n",
      "Nastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\r\n",
      "the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\r\n",
      "he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\r\n",
      "saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\r\n",
      "there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\r\n",
      "him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\r\n",
      "all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\r\n",
      "though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\r\n",
      "the axe! He was overwhelmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what\r\n",
      "made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\r\n",
      "Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\r\n",
      "his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\r\n",
      "for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\r\n",
      "revolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,\r\n",
      "standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little\r\n",
      "dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s\r\n",
      "room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\r\n",
      "right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\r\n",
      "room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\r\n",
      "the porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\r\n",
      "the door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\r\n",
      "it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\r\n",
      "at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\r\n",
      "hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\r\n",
      "“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.\r\n",
      "This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\r\n",
      "suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\r\n",
      "at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\r\n",
      "Suddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose\r\n",
      "from the bottom of his soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\r\n",
      "the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\r\n",
      "the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\r\n",
      "other side....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\r\n",
      "thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\r\n",
      "afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\r\n",
      "by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\r\n",
      "garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\r\n",
      "fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\r\n",
      "the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\r\n",
      "garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\r\n",
      "garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\r\n",
      "great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\r\n",
      "in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\r\n",
      "peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\r\n",
      "are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\r\n",
      "sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\r\n",
      "to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”\r\n",
      " he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\r\n",
      "meets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\r\n",
      "like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\r\n",
      "he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\r\n",
      "somewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\r\n",
      "must be fast!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\r\n",
      "moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\r\n",
      "just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\r\n",
      "the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\r\n",
      "the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\r\n",
      "side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\r\n",
      "noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\r\n",
      "quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\r\n",
      "head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\r\n",
      "woman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\r\n",
      "already on the stairs....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\r\n",
      "once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\r\n",
      "and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\r\n",
      "stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\r\n",
      "one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\r\n",
      "at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\r\n",
      "a minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been\r\n",
      "here, but... it’s two storeys above them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\r\n",
      "flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was\r\n",
      "apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\r\n",
      "torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\r\n",
      "the thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no\r\n",
      "answer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then\r\n",
      "he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\r\n",
      "then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\r\n",
      "himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”\r\n",
      " he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\r\n",
      "better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\r\n",
      "him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\r\n",
      "he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\r\n",
      "rang again, more loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\r\n",
      "was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\r\n",
      "knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\r\n",
      "Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\r\n",
      "suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\r\n",
      "heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\r\n",
      "rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\r\n",
      "close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\r\n",
      "listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\r\n",
      "a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\r\n",
      "the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\r\n",
      "and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\r\n",
      "in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\r\n",
      "had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\r\n",
      "he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\r\n",
      "latch unfastened.\r\n",

      "The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\r\n",
      "suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\r\n",

      "Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\r\n",

      "in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but\r\n",

      "And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\r\n",

      "“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\r\n",
      "the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\r\n",
      "mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\r\n",
      "in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\r\n",
      "he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\r\n",
      "that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\r\n",
      "minute, he thought he would have run away from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,\r\n",
      "also with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am\r\n",
      "in a hurry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\r\n",
      "itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone\r\n",
      "evidently restored her confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,\r\n",
      "looking at the pledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held out her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\r\n",
      "Have you been bathing, or what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve\r\n",
      "nothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\r\n",
      "truth; the old woman took the pledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\r\n",
      "weighing the pledge in her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\r\n",
      "her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\r\n",
      "him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\r\n",
      "unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\r\n",
      "take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\r\n",
      "coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\r\n",
      "more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\r\n",
      "fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with\r\n",
      "vexation and moved towards him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\r\n",
      "it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\r\n",
      "effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\r\n",
      "seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\r\n",
      "brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\r\n",
      "with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and\r\n",
      "fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\r\n",
      "As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\r\n",
      "cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\r\n",
      "floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the\r\n",
      "pledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\r\n",
      "and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\r\n",
      "body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\r\n",
      "face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\r\n",
      "the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\r\n",
      "pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\r\n",
      "from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\r\n",
      "possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\r\n",
      "hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\r\n",
      "particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\r\n",
      "smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\r\n",
      "as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\r\n",
      "with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\r\n",
      "Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\r\n",
      "a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\r\n",
      "drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\r\n",
      "chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\r\n",
      "over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\r\n",
      "away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\r\n",
      "He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\r\n",
      "occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\r\n",
      "still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\r\n",
      "he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\r\n",
      "over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\r\n",
      "she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\r\n",
      "clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\r\n",
      "was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\r\n",
      "it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\r\n",
      "blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\r\n",
      "the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\r\n",
      "with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\r\n",
      "something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\r\n",
      "the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\r\n",
      "dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\r\n",
      "after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\r\n",
      "without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\r\n",
      "purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\r\n",
      "copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\r\n",
      "chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\r\n",
      "very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\r\n",
      "flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the\r\n",
      "bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\r\n",
      "again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\r\n",
      "was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\r\n",
      "mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\r\n",
      "and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\r\n",
      "and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\r\n",
      "there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\r\n",
      "drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\r\n",
      "and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\r\n",
      "of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\r\n",
      "women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\r\n",
      "good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\r\n",
      "lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\r\n",
      "key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\r\n",
      "a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\r\n",
      "then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\r\n",
      "clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\r\n",
      "the red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”\r\n",
      " the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\r\n",
      "“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\r\n",
      "under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\r\n",
      "out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\r\n",
      "all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\r\n",
      "ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\r\n",
      "wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\r\n",
      "tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\r\n",
      "and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\r\n",
      "had not time to take many....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\r\n",
      "short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\r\n",
      "his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\r\n",
      "someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\r\n",
      "a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\r\n",
      "holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\r\n",
      "the bedroom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\r\n",
      "She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\r\n",
      "and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\r\n",
      "of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\r\n",
      "shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\r\n",
      "still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\r\n",
      "corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\r\n",
      "sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\r\n",
      "with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,\r\n",
      "when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\r\n",
      "and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\r\n",
      "simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\r\n",
      "even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\r\n",
      "and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\r\n",
      "She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\r\n",
      "it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\r\n",
      "sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\r\n",
      "head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\r\n",
      "snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\r\n",
      "second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\r\n",
      "as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\r\n",
      "and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\r\n",
      "difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\r\n",
      "absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\r\n",
      "perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\r\n",
      "that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\r\n",
      "have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\r\n",
      "not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\r\n",
      "done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\r\n",
      "stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\r\n",
      "into the room for anything in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\r\n",
      "possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\r\n",
      "was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\r\n",
      "kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\r\n",
      "him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\r\n",
      "He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\r\n",
      "that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\r\n",
      "in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\r\n",
      "blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\r\n",
      "there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\r\n",
      "with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\r\n",
      "then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\r\n",
      "There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\r\n",
      "carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\r\n",
      "possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\r\n",
      "his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\r\n",
      "nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\r\n",
      "But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\r\n",
      "quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\r\n",
      "that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\r\n",
      "of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\r\n",
      "utterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I\r\n",
      "must fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\r\n",
      "awaited him such as he had never known before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\r\n",
      "door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\r\n",
      "was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\r\n",
      "all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\r\n",
      "perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\r\n",
      "afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\r\n",
      "she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\r\n",
      "staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\r\n",
      "two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\r\n",
      "“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\r\n",
      "though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\r\n",
      "but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\r\n",
      "began going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such\r\n",
      "a noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\r\n",
      "waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\r\n",
      "step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\r\n",
      "he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\r\n",
      "began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\r\n",
      "to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\r\n",
      "peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\r\n",
      "_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\r\n",
      "growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\r\n",
      "now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\r\n",
      "him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\r\n",
      "in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\r\n",
      "rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\r\n",
      "started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\r\n",
      "flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\r\n",
      "noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\r\n",
      "done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\r\n",
      "visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\r\n",
      "another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\r\n",
      "the door divided them and he was listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\r\n",
      "indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\r\n",
      "something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\r\n",
      "seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\r\n",
      "and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\r\n",
      "at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\r\n",
      "minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\r\n",
      "possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\r\n",
      "fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\r\n",
      "again. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown\r\n",
      "began to speak and he recovered himself at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a\r\n",
      "thick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\r\n",
      "my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\r\n",
      "the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\r\n",
      "acquaintance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\r\n",
      "stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\r\n",
      "first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a\r\n",
      "cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\r\n",
      "pulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.\r\n",
      "“But how do you come to know me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\r\n",
      "billiards at Gambrinus’.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.\r\n",
      "Where could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\r\n",
      "get some money!” cried the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\r\n",
      "old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.\r\n",
      "And where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here\r\n",
      "from year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\r\n",
      "here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\r\n",
      "anywhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he once more tugged at the door-handle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if\r\n",
      "you pull it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\r\n",
      "the hook clanks?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\r\n",
      "were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\r\n",
      "key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\r\n",
      "is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\r\n",
      "don’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the\r\n",
      "door!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they\r\n",
      "about in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be\r\n",
      "something wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door\r\n",
      "and still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were going down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you’d better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something\r\n",
      "wrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\r\n",
      "tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\r\n",
      "touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\r\n",
      "more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\r\n",
      "bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\r\n",
      "on the inside and so nothing could be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\r\n",
      "delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\r\n",
      "While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\r\n",
      "occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\r\n",
      "door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\r\n",
      "while they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought\r\n",
      "that flashed through his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and\r\n",
      "another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\r\n",
      "sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\r\n",
      "boots on the stairs. The steps died away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What am I to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\r\n",
      "Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\r\n",
      "thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\r\n",
      "below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\r\n",
      "back to the flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hey there! Catch the brute!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\r\n",
      "down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\r\n",
      "still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\r\n",
      "noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\r\n",
      "distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what\r\n",
      "must!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\r\n",
      "lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\r\n",
      "a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\r\n",
      "right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\r\n",
      "second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\r\n",
      "for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\r\n",
      "run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\r\n",
      "instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\r\n",
      "and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\r\n",
      "Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\r\n",
      "waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\r\n",
      "the gateway and turned to the left in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\r\n",
      "flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\r\n",
      "the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\r\n",
      "bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\r\n",
      "completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\r\n",
      "succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\r\n",
      "guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\r\n",
      "going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\r\n",
      "the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he\r\n",
      "slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\r\n",
      "hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\r\n",
      "hopeless!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\r\n",
      "Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\r\n",
      "because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\r\n",
      "grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\r\n",
      "scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\r\n",
      "“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out\r\n",
      "on the canal bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\r\n",
      "worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\r\n",
      "bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\r\n",
      "conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\r\n",
      "falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\r\n",
      "quite a different direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\r\n",
      "house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\r\n",
      "And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\r\n",
      "escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\r\n",
      "incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\r\n",
      "restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But\r\n",
      "it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed\r\n",
      "but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\r\n",
      "home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\r\n",
      "walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\r\n",
      "again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\r\n",
      "back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\r\n",

      "occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get\r\n",
      "light. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.\r\n",
      "Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\r\n",
      "heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock. They woke\r\n",
      "him up now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\r\n",
      "over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\r\n",
      "his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\r\n",
      "teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\r\n",
      "began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\r\n",
      "gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\r\n",
      "could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\r\n",
      "flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\r\n",
      "hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I’m drunk\r\n",
      "but...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\r\n",
      "looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\r\n",
      "no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\r\n",
      "began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\r\n",
      "over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\r\n",
      "his search three times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\r\n",
      "some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\r\n",
      "of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\r\n",
      "threads. There seemed to be nothing more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\r\n",
      "the old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\r\n",
      "then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\r\n",
      "while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\r\n",
      "to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\r\n",
      "everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\r\n",
      "nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\r\n",
      "come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\r\n",
      "stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All\r\n",
      "out of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and\r\n",
      "gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\r\n",
      "he shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:\r\n",
      "“what’s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\r\n",
      "things?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\r\n",
      "money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?\r\n",
      "My reason’s deserting me--simply!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\r\n",
      "unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\r\n",
      "him his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\r\n",
      "rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\r\n",
      "delirium. He lost consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\r\n",
      "and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\r\n",
      "taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\r\n",
      "Such a piece of evidence!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\r\n",
      "among his linen under the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\r\n",
      "think not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\r\n",
      "him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\r\n",
      "forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\r\n",
      "and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\r\n",
      "insufferable torture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming\r\n",
      "upon me? It is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\r\n",
      "floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\r\n",
      "were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\r\n",
      "stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\r\n",
      "his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\r\n",
      "clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\r\n",
      "purse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\r\n",
      "the wet purse in my pocket!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\r\n",
      "traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\r\n",
      "memory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with\r\n",
      "a deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s\r\n",
      "delirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\r\n",
      "trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\r\n",
      "sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\r\n",
      "flung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\r\n",
      "blood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I\r\n",
      "to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\r\n",
      "But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\r\n",
      "go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he\r\n",
      "repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,\r\n",
      "without lingering...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\r\n",
      "shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\r\n",
      "“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\r\n",
      "it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times\r\n",
      "he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted\r\n",
      "Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together\r\n",
      "he’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s\r\n",
      "past ten.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\r\n",
      "positive pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to\r\n",
      "bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\r\n",
      "up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?\r\n",
      "Come what may!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\r\n",
      "bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\r\n",
      "desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\r\n",
      "paper sealed with bottle-wax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what office?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To the police?... What for?...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\r\n",
      "go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\r\n",
      "The porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since\r\n",
      "yesterday,” she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\r\n",
      "opening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,\r\n",
      "seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and\r\n",
      "so don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\r\n",
      "trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\r\n",
      "with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\r\n",
      "half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\r\n",
      "and so fallen asleep again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\r\n",
      "got hold of a treasure...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\r\n",
      "eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\r\n",
      "reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\r\n",
      "with a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I’ll go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As you please.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She followed the porter out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\r\n",
      "and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\r\n",
      "distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\r\n",
      "thank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\r\n",
      "reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\r\n",
      "ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\r\n",
      "half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\r\n",
      "the police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.\r\n",
      "“Good God, only get it over soon!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\r\n",
      "laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!\r\n",
      "Shall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier\r\n",
      "still and the traces will be gone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\r\n",
      "and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\r\n",
      "he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking\r\n",
      "at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\r\n",
      "mind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have\r\n",
      "finished by getting it on!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”\r\n",
      " he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They\r\n",
      "want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as\r\n",
      "he went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost\r\n",
      "light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\r\n",
      "they were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose\r\n",
      "to search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was\r\n",
      "possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\r\n",
      "it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\r\n",
      "fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\r\n",
      "from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\r\n",
      "pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\r\n",
      "so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\r\n",
      "round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\r\n",
      "street on a bright sunny day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\r\n",
      "trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\r\n",
      "his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew\r\n",
      "near the police-station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\r\n",
      "moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\r\n",
      "for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\r\n",
      "he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\r\n",
      "a book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\r\n",
      "here,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\r\n",
      "to ask questions of anyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as\r\n",
      "he reached the fourth floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\r\n",
      "kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\r\n",
      "the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\r\n",
      "was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\r\n",
      "arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\r\n",
      "the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\r\n",
      "too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\r\n",
      "paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\r\n",
      "All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\r\n",
      "on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\r\n",
      "clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\r\n",
      "queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He showed the notice he had received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, formerly a student.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\r\n",
      "particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\r\n",
      "interest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the\r\n",
      "furthest room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\r\n",
      "packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\r\n",
      "Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\r\n",
      "table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\r\n",
      "The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\r\n",
      "excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\r\n",
      "saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\r\n",
      "at it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in\r\n",
      "mourning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\r\n",
      "courage and be calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\r\n",
      "Hm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It\r\n",
      "makes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\r\n",
      "his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\r\n",
      "something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\r\n",
      "the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\r\n",
      "and guess something from his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\r\n",
      "face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\r\n",
      "foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\r\n",
      "and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\r\n",
      "on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\r\n",
      "was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the\r\n",
      "gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\r\n",
      "venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\r\n",
      "into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\r\n",
      "about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\r\n",
      "smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\r\n",
      "the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\r\n",
      "impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\r\n",
      "some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\r\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\r\n",
      "sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\r\n",
      "seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\r\n",
      "officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\r\n",
      "sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\r\n",
      "had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\r\n",
      "face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\r\n",
      "a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\r\n",
      "humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\r\n",
      "clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\r\n",
      "him, so that he felt positively affronted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\r\n",
      "fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk\r\n",
      "interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he\r\n",
      "flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly\r\n",
      "not _that_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\r\n",
      "load was lifted from his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the\r\n",
      "assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\r\n",
      "aggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\r\n",
      "suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that\r\n",
      "I have come here ill with fever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kindly refrain from shouting!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting\r\n",
      "at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\r\n",
      "could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re\r\n",
      "smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\r\n",
      "to all of us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent was obviously disconcerted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\r\n",
      "“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\r\n",
      "Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your\r\n",
      "debts! You’re a fine bird!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\r\n",
      "paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\r\n",
      "time, and still did not understand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\r\n",
      "either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\r\n",
      "declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\r\n",
      "to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\r\n",
      "property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\r\n",
      "against you according to the law.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\r\n",
      "roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\r\n",
      "for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\r\n",
      "months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\r\n",
      "We therefore summon you, hereupon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But she is my landlady!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if she is your landlady?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\r\n",
      "and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\r\n",
      "for the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”\r\n",
      " But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\r\n",
      "worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\r\n",
      "read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\r\n",
      "all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\r\n",
      "overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\r\n",
      "without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\r\n",
      "or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\r\n",
      "of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\r\n",
      "something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming\r\n",
      "and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\r\n",
      "unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\r\n",
      "with an exceedingly silly smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\r\n",
      "lady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house\r\n",
      "last night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.\r\n",
      "Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\r\n",
      "I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\r\n",
      "eleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the\r\n",
      "smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\r\n",
      "meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\r\n",
      "listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\r\n",
      "nerves were on edge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\r\n",
      "short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\r\n",
      "be stopped except by force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\r\n",
      "storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\r\n",
      "abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\r\n",
      "smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\r\n",
      "curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\r\n",
      "word: and at last she found it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she\r\n",
      "pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\r\n",
      "though with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his\r\n",
      "honour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\r\n",
      "scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\r\n",
      "again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\r\n",
      "with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\r\n",
      "he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\r\n",
      "so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\r\n",
      "I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\r\n",
      "eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\r\n",
      "cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\r\n",
      "the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\r\n",
      "squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\r\n",
      "And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\r\n",
      "Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\r\n",
      "pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\r\n",
      "roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\r\n",
      "all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all\r\n",
      "the papers about you.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he was an author?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\r\n",
      "house....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\r\n",
      "head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\r\n",
      "you for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal\r\n",
      "in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\r\n",
      "lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\r\n",
      "man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable\r\n",
      "house’? A nice set, these authors!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal\r\n",
      "the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\r\n",
      "would not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was\r\n",
      "another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\r\n",
      "language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\r\n",
      "daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop\r\n",
      "the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\r\n",
      "town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\r\n",
      "day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\r\n",
      "directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\r\n",
      "stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\r\n",
      "face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\r\n",
      "the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\r\n",
      "to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\r\n",
      "fluttered out of the office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\r\n",
      "Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are\r\n",
      "fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\r\n",
      "and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\r\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,\r\n",
      "or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\r\n",
      "an I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\r\n",
      "being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\r\n",
      "against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\r\n",
      "just look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he\r\n",
      "is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\r\n",
      "you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\r\n",
      "went too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\r\n",
      "you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\r\n",
      "stopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of\r\n",
      "gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\r\n",
      "at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\r\n",
      "to them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to\r\n",
      "ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\r\n",
      "and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\r\n",
      "studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\r\n",
      "have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\r\n",
      "me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\r\n",
      "exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\r\n",
      "last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\r\n",
      "don’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\r\n",
      "I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\r\n",
      "his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\r\n",
      "appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\r\n",
      "oblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her\r\n",
      "for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\r\n",
      "confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\r\n",
      "was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\r\n",
      "her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\r\n",
      "that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\r\n",
      "days, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to\r\n",
      "waste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\r\n",
      "but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\r\n",
      "exceedingly difficult to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\r\n",
      "happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\r\n",
      "But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\r\n",
      "before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\r\n",
      "to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\r\n",
      "but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\r\n",
      "roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\r\n",
      "she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\r\n",
      "never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\r\n",
      "of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\r\n",
      "eat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch\r\n",
      "interrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your\r\n",
      "love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\r\n",
      "that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\r\n",
      "the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will dictate to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\r\n",
      "contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\r\n",
      "completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took\r\n",
      "place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\r\n",
      "he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\r\n",
      "that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\r\n",
      "those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\r\n",
      "with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\r\n",
      "would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\r\n",
      "gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\r\n",
      "conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\r\n",
      "effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s\r\n",
      "triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\r\n",
      "Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\r\n",
      "vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\r\n",
      "sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\r\n",
      "hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\r\n",
      "him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\r\n",
      "he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\r\n",
      "never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\r\n",
      "effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\r\n",
      "if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\r\n",
      "it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\r\n",
      "circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\r\n",
      "sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\r\n",
      "conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\r\n",
      "sensations he had known in his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\r\n",
      "he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\r\n",

      "to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\r\n",
      "in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\r\n",
      "to carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his\r\n",
      "mind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once\r\n",
      "he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\r\n",

      "had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\r\n",
      "that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\r\n",
      "the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\r\n",
      "with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\r\n",
      "porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\r\n",
      "have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\r\n",
      "Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went\r\n",
      "up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\r\n",
      "just consider...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\r\n",
      "themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\r\n",
      "later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\r\n",
      "unfastened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\r\n",
      "in; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\r\n",
      "an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\r\n",
      "interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\r\n",
      "himself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\r\n",
      "killed me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\r\n",

      "he, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\r\n",
      "the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "all those things in the hole?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the\r\n",

      "all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly\r\n",

      "merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked\r\n",
      "like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his\r\n",
      "overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal\r\n",
      "them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\r\n",
      "his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and\r\n",
      "though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of\r\n",
      "pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an\r\n",
      "hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\r\n",
      "all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything\r\n",
      "up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....\r\n",
      "Where was he to go?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces\r\n",
      "hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in\r\n",
      "the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\r\n",
      "get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\r\n",
      "rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\r\n",
      "the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\r\n",
      "several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\r\n",
      "think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,\r\n",
      "and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\r\n",
      "people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\r\n",
      "from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\r\n",
      "down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\r\n",
      "the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\r\n",
      "Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\r\n",
      "they had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my\r\n",
      "fancy?” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\r\n",
      "Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\r\n",
      "and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\r\n",
      "off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\r\n",
      "worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\r\n",
      "before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\r\n",
      "because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\r\n",
      "and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\r\n",
      "another idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\r\n",
      "somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\r\n",
      "in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\r\n",
      "perhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\r\n",
      "seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\r\n",
      "coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\r\n",
      "passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\r\n",
      "hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\r\n",
      "into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\r\n",
      "twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\r\n",
      "was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\r\n",
      "lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\r\n",
      "apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\r\n",
      "was probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place\r\n",
      "from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\r\n",
      "throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\r\n",
      "at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\r\n",
      "there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\r\n",
      "been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here\r\n",
      "strictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing\r\n",
      "suspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and\r\n",
      "get away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\r\n",
      "against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\r\n",
      "stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\r\n",
      "street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\r\n",
      "could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\r\n",
      "street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\r\n",
      "and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\r\n",
      "hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\r\n",
      "The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\r\n",
      "seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\r\n",
      "in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\r\n",
      "he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\r\n",
      "Nothing could be noticed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\r\n",
      "almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\r\n",
      "the police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\r\n",
      "looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\r\n",
      "the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\r\n",
      "found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.\r\n",
      "Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\r\n",
      "laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\r\n",
      "when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\r\n",
      "upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\r\n",
      "mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\r\n",
      "on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\r\n",
      "would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\r\n",
      "given the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\r\n",
      "seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\r\n",
      "really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\r\n",
      "point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\r\n",
      "“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\r\n",
      "stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\r\n",
      "upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\r\n",
      "care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\r\n",
      "is not that at all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\r\n",
      "question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\r\n",
      "I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\r\n",
      "glance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have\r\n",
      "undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\r\n",
      "filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\r\n",
      "water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\r\n",
      "either... how’s that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\r\n",
      "it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\r\n",
      "without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\r\n",
      "it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\r\n",
      "understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\r\n",
      "moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\r\n",
      "of it.... Yes, so it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been\r\n",
      "worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....\r\n",
      "Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\r\n",
      "worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\r\n",
      "if I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\r\n",
      "distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\r\n",
      "overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\r\n",
      "every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\r\n",
      "everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\r\n",
      "All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\r\n",
      "movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\r\n",
      "might have spat at him or bitten him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\r\n",
      "the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”\r\n",
      " he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\r\n",
      "it’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\r\n",
      "have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\r\n",
      "mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\r\n",
      "day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\r\n",
      "now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\r\n",
      "he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\r\n",
      "other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\r\n",
      "his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\r\n",
      "brief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve\r\n",
      "cut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,\r\n",
      "you are tired, I’ll be bound.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\r\n",
      "in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\r\n",
      "visitor was ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his\r\n",
      "pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\r\n",
      "wanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching\r\n",
      "him carefully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\r\n",
      "face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\r\n",
      "disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\r\n",
      "wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\r\n",
      "himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\r\n",
      "is... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\r\n",
      "help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I\r\n",
      "mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\r\n",
      "Nothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy. I am by\r\n",
      "myself... alone. Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.”\r\n",

      "“Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all\r\n",

      "there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\r\n",
      "I would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a\r\n",

      "a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\r\n",
      "Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\r\n",
      "bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\r\n",
      "and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\r\n",
      "The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\r\n",

      "still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\r\n",
      "especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\r\n",
      "hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\r\n",
      "gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\r\n",
      "a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\r\n",
      "cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\r\n",
      "every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\r\n",
      "himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\r\n",
      "those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\r\n",
      "no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\r\n",
      "grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\r\n",
      "as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\r\n",
      "interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\r\n",
      "so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\r\n",
      "heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\r\n",
      "now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\r\n",
      "his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\r\n",
      "felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\r\n",
      "from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\r\n",
      "suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\r\n",
      "hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\r\n",
      "the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\r\n",
      "himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\r\n",
      "walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\r\n",
      "Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\r\n",
      "sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\r\n",
      "scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\r\n",
      "blows and curses he had never heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\r\n",
      "sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\r\n",
      "and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\r\n",
      "he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\r\n",
      "wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\r\n",
      "out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\r\n",
      "beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\r\n",
      "her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\r\n",
      "a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\r\n",
      "and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\r\n",
      "banging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told\r\n",
      "from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\r\n",
      "topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\r\n",
      "and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\r\n",
      "banging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking\r\n",
      "seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\r\n",
      "they would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about\r\n",
      "that... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door\r\n",
      "with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\r\n",
      "be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\r\n",
      "him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\r\n",
      "began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\r\n",
      "too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have\r\n",
      "gone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\r\n",
      "weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\r\n",
      "going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\r\n",
      "to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\r\n",
      "whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\r\n",
      "of the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\r\n",
      "here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\r\n",
      "lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\r\n",
      "infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\r\n",
      "light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\r\n",
      "of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\r\n",
      "asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\r\n",
      "had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging\r\n",
      "about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Who beat the landlady?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\r\n",
      "and... why was he here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\r\n",
      "long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\r\n",
      "herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\r\n",
      "wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,\r\n",
      "resolute voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he\r\n",
      "said still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\r\n",
      "flats.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When\r\n",

      "things.... Will you eat something?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\r\n",
      "was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\r\n",
      "He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\r\n",
      "there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\r\n",
      "somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\r\n",
      "him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\r\n",
      "of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\r\n",
      "they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\r\n",
      "at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\r\n",
      "another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\r\n",
      "not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\r\n",
      "Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\r\n",
      "it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\r\n",
      "no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\r\n",
      "something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\r\n",
      "to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\r\n",
      "terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\r\n",
      "always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\r\n",
      "forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\r\n",
      "into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\r\n",
      "wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\r\n",
      "with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\r\n",
      "very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\r\n",
      "short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\r\n",
      "peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is himself,” echoed the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\r\n",
      "door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\r\n",
      "discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\r\n",
      "and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\r\n",
      "laziness, and absurdly bashful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\r\n",
      "the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\r\n",
      "Razumihin came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call\r\n",

      "from Pashenka.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is\r\n",
      "Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\r\n",
      "Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\r\n",
      "you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\r\n",
      "I’ve come on business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\r\n",
      "table. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\r\n",
      "anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\r\n",
      "you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\r\n",
      "once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\r\n",
      "Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\r\n",
      "had enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you\r\n",
      "will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\r\n",
      "name. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will\r\n",
      "you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\r\n",
      "they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\r\n",

      "from our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in\r\n",
      "an intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\r\n",
      "Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.\r\n",
      "Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But\r\n",
      "that’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\r\n",
      "judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\r\n",
      "hand and he will sign it. Here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I can come another time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\r\n",
      "Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made\r\n",
      "ready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there any soup?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\r\n",
      "unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\r\n",
      "would happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\r\n",
      "that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\r\n",
      "spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\r\n",
      "table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\r\n",
      "up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\r\n",
      "carry out his orders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\r\n",
      "left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and\r\n",
      "with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\r\n",
      "it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\r\n",
      "giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\r\n",
      "said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on\r\n",
      "without the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,\r\n",
      "pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he\r\n",
      "had not touched food for three days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\r\n",
      "mumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear\r\n",
      "little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\r\n",
      "don’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya\r\n",
      "with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have\r\n",
      "some beer?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get along with your nonsense!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A cup of tea, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A cup of tea, maybe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\r\n",
      "before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up\r\n",
      "and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\r\n",
      "earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\r\n",
      "means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\r\n",
      "no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\r\n",
      "without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\r\n",
      "even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\r\n",
      "animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\r\n",
      "low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\r\n",
      "of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\r\n",
      "Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\r\n",
      "spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\r\n",
      "capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\r\n",
      "pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\r\n",
      "that, too, and took note of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some\r\n",
      "raspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking\r\n",
      "his soup and beer again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing\r\n",
      "a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of\r\n",
      "sugar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\r\n",
      "have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\r\n",
      "that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\r\n",
      "resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\r\n",
      "How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\r\n",
      "forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\r\n",
      "it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\r\n",
      "Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s\r\n",
      "house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but\r\n",
      "Buch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\r\n",
      "went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\r\n",
      "two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My name!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while\r\n",
      "I was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\r\n",
      "place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\r\n",
      "everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\r\n",
      "Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\r\n",
      "and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. “I am\r\n",
      "not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her\r\n",
      "mirth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\r\n",
      "I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\r\n",
      "influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\r\n",
      "expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\r\n",
      "think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\r\n",
      "full of alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went\r\n",
      "on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\r\n",
      "her unspeakable delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\r\n",
      "at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\r\n",
      "to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\r\n",
      "character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\r\n",
      "she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\r\n",
      "mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\r\n",
      "Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s\r\n",
      "a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\r\n",
      "foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\r\n",
      "you would think at first sight?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\r\n",
      "to keep up the conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\r\n",
      "of him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\r\n",
      "essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\r\n",
      "I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\r\n",
      "of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\r\n",
      "intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\r\n",
      "sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\r\n",
      "I don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\r\n",
      "are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\r\n",
      "that through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as\r\n",
      "a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\r\n",
      "dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\r\n",
      "And she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\r\n",
      "the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\r\n",
      "a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\r\n",
      "Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\r\n",
      "thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\r\n",
      "the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\r\n",
      "question, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\r\n",
      "because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\r\n",
      "twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\r\n",
      "too, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building\r\n",
      "upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\r\n",
      "now, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with\r\n",
      "Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\r\n",
      "a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\r\n",
      "open; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,\r\n",
      "then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\r\n",
      "hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\r\n",
      "I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\r\n",
      "harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\r\n",
      "the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\r\n",
      "brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\r\n",
      "roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\r\n",
      "presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\r\n",
      "have torn it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\r\n",
      "turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\r\n",
      "twinge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the\r\n",
      "fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\r\n",
      "I have only made you cross.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "asked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\r\n",
      "Zametov one day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly\r\n",
      "and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\r\n",
      "make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\r\n",
      "could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\r\n",
      "fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\r\n",
      "friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\r\n",
      "you know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\r\n",
      "once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did I say anything in delirium?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did I rave about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\r\n",
      "brother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table\r\n",
      "and took up his cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did I rave about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t\r\n",
      "worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\r\n",
      "about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\r\n",
      "Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\r\n",
      "assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\r\n",
      "to you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov\r\n",
      "hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\r\n",
      "ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\r\n",
      "comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\r\n",
      "thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\r\n",
      "somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\r\n",
      "piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\r\n",
      "of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\r\n",
      "thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\r\n",
      "of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\r\n",
      "though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\r\n",
      "you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\r\n",
      "wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\r\n",
      "myself. Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went\r\n",
      "out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\r\n",
      "running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\r\n",
      "say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\r\n",
      "bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\r\n",
      "impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\r\n",
      "work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\r\n",
      "if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\r\n",
      "and then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long\r\n",
      "ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve\r\n",
      "forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\r\n",
      "a minute ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\r\n",
      "about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\r\n",
      "what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\r\n",
      "the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\r\n",
      "put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\r\n",
      "stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\r\n",
      "his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\r\n",
      "he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\r\n",
      "about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\r\n",
      "the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\r\n",
      "Zametov could not have seen anything on it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\r\n",
      "office? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\r\n",
      "looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\r\n",
      "what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,\r\n",
      "helplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in\r\n",
      "delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\r\n",
      "escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\r\n",
      "where? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!\r\n",
      "They’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\r\n",
      "over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...\r\n",
      "I’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find\r\n",
      "me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find\r\n",
      "me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\r\n",
      "do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\r\n",
      "else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,\r\n",
      "ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\r\n",
      "only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\r\n",
      "there--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\r\n",
      "bottle, cold!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\r\n",
      "gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\r\n",
      "But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\r\n",
      "even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\r\n",
      "quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\r\n",
      "disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\r\n",
      "a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\r\n",
      "closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\r\n",
      "ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\r\n",
      "sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\r\n",
      "Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\r\n",
      "not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\r\n",
      "trying to recall something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”\r\n",

      "directly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six\r\n",
      "o’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! Have I?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\r\n",
      "We’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for\r\n",
      "you; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov\r\n",
      "twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\r\n",
      "I’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,\r\n",
      "moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s\r\n",
      "no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\r\n",
      "directly. And how do you feel now, brother?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How long have you been coming here?”\r\n",

      "“Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you remember?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\r\n",
      "not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\r\n",
      "not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\r\n",
      "look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\r\n",
      "boy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we\r\n",
      "must make a man of you. Let’s begin from the top. Do you see this\r\n",
      "cap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and\r\n",
      "ordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\r\n",
      "I shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.\r\n",
      "Just right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A\r\n",
      "proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\r\n",
      "its own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off\r\n",
      "his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other\r\n",
      "people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\r\n",
      "politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;\r\n",
      "he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of\r\n",
      "headgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,\r\n",
      "battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or\r\n",
      "this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\r\n",
      "Nastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\r\n",
      "speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended. “Why, nowadays you would\r\n",
      "cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been\r\n",
      "worn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will\r\n",
      "give you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to\r\n",
      "the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\r\n",
      "you I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a\r\n",
      "pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. “No holes, no\r\n",
      "spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat\r\n",
      "to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\r\n",
      "improvement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\r\n",
      "the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\r\n",
      "seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\r\n",
      "your money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s\r\n",
      "summer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be\r\n",
      "wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...\r\n",
      "especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of\r\n",
      "coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What\r\n",
      "do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\r\n",
      "if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\r\n",
      "do business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,\r\n",
      "you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your\r\n",
      "own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are\r\n",
      "a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work\r\n",
      "and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\r\n",
      "week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\r\n",
      "Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not fit? Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. “I did not go\r\n",
      "empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.\r\n",
      "And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin\r\n",
      "with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well\r\n",
      "now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the\r\n",
      "suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the\r\n",
      "boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles\r\n",
      "fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were\r\n",
      "bought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.\r\n",
      "Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\r\n",
      "you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\r\n",
      "serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s\r\n",
      "clothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\r\n",
      "to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\r\n",
      "for your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for\r\n",
      "anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you\r\n",
      "will throw off your illness with your shirt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me be! I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened\r\n",
      "with disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”\r\n",
      " Razumihin insisted. “Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s\r\n",
      "it,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen. The\r\n",
      "latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought. “What money was\r\n",
      "all that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your\r\n",
      "mother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\r\n",
      "and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\r\n",
      "his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\r\n",
      "loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\r\n",
      "fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\r\n",
      "watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\r\n",
      "nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\r\n",
      "efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\r\n",
      "instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\r\n",
      "at his work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come to himself,”\r\n",
      " cried Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\r\n",
      "sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his\r\n",
      "linen and he almost cried.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\r\n",
      "it.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively\r\n",
      "and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\r\n",
      "glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\r\n",
      "the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good.... Going on all right,” he said lazily. “Has he eaten\r\n",
      "anything?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They told him, and asked what he might have.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of\r\n",
      "course, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...\r\n",
      "but no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each\r\n",
      "other. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow.\r\n",
      "Perhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin. “We are\r\n",
      "going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,\r\n",
      "maybe... but we’ll see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s\r\n",
      "only a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You\r\n",
      "are coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov. “Don’t forget, you promised.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a\r\n",
      "little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I\r\n",
      "am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation\r\n",
      "Department here... But you know him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is he a relation of yours, too?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,\r\n",
      "as it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take bribes,”\r\n",
      " Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. “I don’t praise him for\r\n",
      "taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one\r\n",
      "looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure\r\n",

      "not repel him. You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially\r\n",
      "a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive\r\n",
      "dullards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running another man\r\n",
      "down.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”\r\n",

      "examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\r\n",
      "petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we\r\n",
      "have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\r\n",

      "their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\r\n",
      "first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\r\n",
      "it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\r\n",
      "murderers--that was their logic!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\r\n",

      "accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\r\n",
      "unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\r\n",
      "dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s\r\n",
      "case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The\r\n",
      "day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the\r\n",
      "hour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\r\n",
      "already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\r\n",
      "asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\r\n",
      "them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\r\n",
      "anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a\r\n",
      "rouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\r\n",
      "with another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on\r\n",
      "drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\r\n",
      "the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\r\n",
      "rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;\r\n",
      "he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\r\n",
      "a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\r\n",
      "thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\r\n",
      "afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known\r\n",
      "this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\r\n",
      "province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\r\n",
      "Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\r\n",
      "house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\r\n",
      "As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\r\n",
      "took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\r\n",
      "And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\r\n",
      "her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\r\n",
      "suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\r\n",
      "lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\r\n",
      "inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is\r\n",
      "Nikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\r\n",
      "had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\r\n",
      "and went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the\r\n",
      "job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\r\n",
      "the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\r\n",
      "anyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about\r\n",
      "the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\r\n",
      "o’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw\r\n",
      "Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\r\n",
      "understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\r\n",
      "speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\r\n",
      "on a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I\r\n",
      "haven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”\r\n",
      " “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those\r\n",
      "ear-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said\r\n",
      "it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened\r\n",
      "that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.\r\n",
      "“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,\r\n",
      "his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\r\n",
      "told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\r\n",
      "to keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”\r\n",
      " And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\r\n",
      "bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\r\n",
      "I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\r\n",
      "doing, as clear as could be....’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;\r\n",
      "they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\r\n",
      "the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\r\n",
      "yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\r\n",
      "had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\r\n",
      "for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\r\n",
      "to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\r\n",
      "adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\r\n",
      "block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\r\n",
      "screeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’\r\n",
      "‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess\r\n",
      "everything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is\r\n",
      "here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\r\n",
      "he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working\r\n",
      "with Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\r\n",
      "time?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\r\n",
      "not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’\r\n",
      "‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\r\n",
      "day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I\r\n",
      "never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\r\n",
      "Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the\r\n",
      "ear-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work\r\n",
      "with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were\r\n",
      "you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away\r\n",
      "from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were\r\n",
      "you frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be\r\n",
      "frightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not\r\n",
      "believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\r\n",
      "for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\r\n",
      "of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\r\n",
      "him and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\r\n",
      "where I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and\r\n",
      "I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\r\n",
      "Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\r\n",
      "I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\r\n",
      "ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\r\n",
      "were there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\r\n",
      "porter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\r\n",
      "and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\r\n",
      "too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s\r\n",
      "hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\r\n",
      "me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\r\n",
      "but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\r\n",
      "the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\r\n",
      "to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\r\n",
      "together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\r\n",
      "corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\r\n",
      "up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\r\n",
      "and in the box were the ear-rings....’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\r\n",
      "slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up\r\n",
      "from his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\r\n",
      "silent for a while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking\r\n",
      "inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\r\n",
      "everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\r\n",
      "a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\r\n",
      "went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\r\n",
      "‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’\r\n",
      "‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’\r\n",
      "‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’\r\n",
      "‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now\r\n",
      "what do you suppose they deduced from that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\r\n",
      "wouldn’t have your painter set free?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "doubt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\r\n",
      "must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\r\n",
      "woman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there\r\n",
      "somehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”\r\n",

      "“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\r\n",
      "opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\r\n",
      "to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at\r\n",
      "once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\r\n",
      "truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\r\n",
      "on the box and picked it up.”\r\n",

      "hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\r\n",
      "thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’\r\n",
      "(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\r\n",
      "squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\r\n",
      "one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\r\n",
      "note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\r\n",
      "found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\r\n",

      "question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\r\n",
      "scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\r\n",
      "robbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\r\n",
      "the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\r\n",
      "that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\r\n",
      "rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\r\n",

      "hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\r\n",
      "piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\r\n",
      "given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\r\n",
      "against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\r\n",
      "innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\r\n",
      "do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\r\n",
      "accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\r\n",
      "simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\r\n",
      "breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\r\n",
      "won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case\r\n",
      "and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he\r\n",

      "proved conclusively that it was his.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "evidence about that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\r\n",
      "They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\r\n",
      "on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\r\n",
      "there actually were men at work in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\r\n",

      "How do you explain the facts yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any\r\n",
      "rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\r\n",
      "the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\r\n",
      "The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\r\n",
      "at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\r\n",
      "murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\r\n",
      "escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\r\n",
      "Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\r\n",
      "porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\r\n",
      "hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\r\n",
      "and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\r\n",
      "possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\r\n",
      "in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\r\n",
      "he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\r\n",
      "had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\r\n",
      "he did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”\r\n",

      "“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\r\n",

      "This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\r\n",
      "and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\r\n",
      "doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\r\n",
      "as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\r\n",
      "Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\r\n",
      "affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the\r\n",
      "same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\r\n",
      "unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\r\n",
      "the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\r\n",
      "unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\r\n",
      "face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\r\n",
      "couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\r\n",
      "took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\r\n",
      "that he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,\r\n",
      "the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\r\n",
      "emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\r\n",

      "himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\r\n",
      "gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\r\n",
      "lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\r\n",
      "watch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\r\n",
      "and lazily proceeded to put it back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\r\n",
      "persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\r\n",
      "his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\r\n",
      "was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\r\n",
      "undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\r\n",
      "the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\r\n",
      "then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”\r\n",
      " he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\r\n",
      "weak and breaking, voice articulated:\r\n",

      "behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\r\n",
      "Luzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\r\n",

      "suddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\r\n",
      "crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\r\n",
      "table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\r\n",
      "visitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was\r\n",
      "impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\r\n",
      "and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\r\n",
      "Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for\r\n",
      "the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\r\n",
      "has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\r\n",
      "I am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\r\n",

      "business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on\r\n",
      "Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\r\n",
      "that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\r\n",

      "student.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all right, go on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\r\n",
      "assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\r\n",
      "astonishment...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\r\n",
      "“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,\r\n",
      "but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\r\n",
      "meant. There was a moment’s silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\r\n",
      "answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\r\n",
      "though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\r\n",
      "new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\r\n",
      "him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole\r\n",
      "appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so\r\n",
      "unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\r\n",
      "too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\r\n",
      "days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\r\n",
      "of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\r\n",
      "indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\r\n",
      "agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\r\n",
      "circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of\r\n",
      "fiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all\r\n",
      "right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\r\n",
      "the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\r\n",
      "exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\r\n",
      "if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\r\n",
      "his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\r\n",
      "light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\r\n",
      "cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\r\n",
      "of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\r\n",
      "handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\r\n",
      "His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\r\n",
      "growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\r\n",
      "touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\r\n",
      "at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\r\n",
      "usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\r\n",
      "If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\r\n",
      "good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\r\n",
      "causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\r\n",
      "malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\r\n",
      "notice of their oddities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,\r\n",
      "again breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your\r\n",
      "illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\r\n",
      "have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\r\n",
      "other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\r\n",
      "mamma and sister any minute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\r\n",
      "some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\r\n",
      "followed, he went on:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.\r\n",

      "“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of\r\n",
      "rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, rooms...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful\r\n",
      "character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\r\n",
      "people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s\r\n",
      "cheap, though...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\r\n",

      "two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\r\n",
      "I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,\r\n",
      "addressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\r\n",
      "myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\r\n",
      "of Bakaleyev’s house, too...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\r\n",
      "know him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\r\n",
      "A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\r\n",
      "learns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\r\n",
      "as though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I\r\n",
      "visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\r\n",
      "the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\r\n",
      "And it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\r\n",
      "younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\r\n",
      "clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.\r\n",
      "“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\r\n",
      "heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\r\n",
      "all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish\r\n",
      "form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\r\n",
      "Anyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\r\n",
      "enjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\r\n",
      "but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\r\n",
      "enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\r\n",
      "has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\r\n",
      "It’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\r\n",
      "accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\r\n",
      "circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\r\n",
      "Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\r\n",
      "rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\r\n",
      "off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\r\n",
      "thing...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\r\n",
      "no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\r\n",
      "“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\r\n",
      "triumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there\r\n",
      "is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\r\n",
      "economic truth...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love\r\n",
      "thy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\r\n",
      "excessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\r\n",
      "neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\r\n",
      "it, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells\r\n",
      "us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\r\n",
      "self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\r\n",
      "and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\r\n",
      "affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\r\n",
      "firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\r\n",
      "organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\r\n",
      "myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\r\n",
      "pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\r\n",
      "from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\r\n",
      "advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\r\n",
      "reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\r\n",
      "would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,\r\n",
      "“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve\r\n",
      "grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\r\n",
      "oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\r\n",
      "by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\r\n",
      "hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,\r\n",
      "that’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\r\n",
      "are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\r\n",
      "cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\r\n",

      "enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin\r\n",

      "practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\r\n",

      "“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a\r\n",
      "voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that\r\n",
      "you told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what\r\n",
      "pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better\r\n",
      "to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over\r\n",
      "her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with\r\n",
      "confusion, “to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to\r\n",
      "assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,\r\n",
      "has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect\r\n",
      "who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed\r\n",
      "to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat\r\n",
      "high-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles\r\n",
      "from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in\r\n",
      "so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\r\n",
      "fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.\r\n",
      "Silence lasted for some seconds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my\r\n",
      "mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. “Let me tell\r\n",
      "you, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\r\n",
      "but breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed\r\n",
      "to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\r\n",
      "a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\r\n",
      "this...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So much the worse...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go to hell!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing\r\n",
      "between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\r\n",
      "pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who\r\n",
      "had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,\r\n",
      "he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid\r\n",
      "crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of\r\n",
      "his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in\r\n",
      "perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.\r\n",
      "“Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am\r\n",
      "not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,\r\n",
      "alone, alone!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But we can’t leave him like this!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin\r\n",
      "thought a minute and ran to overtake him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs. “He\r\n",
      "mustn’t be irritated.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter with him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it! At\r\n",
      "first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some\r\n",
      "fixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation\r\n",
      "I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a\r\n",
      "letter about it just before his illness....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have\r\n",
      "you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to\r\n",
      "anything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too. He is interested,\r\n",
      "frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police\r\n",
      "office; he fainted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something\r\n",
      "afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I’ll go and see\r\n",
      "him again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the\r\n",
      "parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\r\n",
      "and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\r\n",
      "perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\r\n",
      "fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\r\n",
      "sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\r\n",
      "evident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood\r\n",
      "that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\r\n",
      "strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\r\n",
      "fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\r\n",
      "looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought\r\n",
      "put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\r\n",
      "copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\r\n",
      "Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\r\n",
      "glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\r\n",
      "to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would\r\n",
      "have dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\r\n",
      "street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\r\n",
      "before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\r\n",
      "felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\r\n",
      "feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\r\n",
      "did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all\r\n",
      "_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would\r\n",
      "not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\r\n",
      "that_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\r\n",
      "he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\r\n",
      "tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\r\n",
      "changed “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable\r\n",
      "self-confidence and determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\r\n",
      "Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\r\n",
      "the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\r\n",
      "sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\r\n",
      "on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\r\n",
      "mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\r\n",
      "old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\r\n",
      "coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\r\n",
      "the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\r\n",
      "copeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\r\n",
      "sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”\r\n",
      " and both moved on to the next shop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\r\n",
      "man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\r\n",
      "manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\r\n",
      "on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\r\n",
      "passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\r\n",
      "snow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I\r\n",
      "mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\r\n",
      "question and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\r\n",
      "other side of the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay\r\n",
      "Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but\r\n",
      "they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\r\n",
      "and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a\r\n",
      "corn chandler’s shop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing\r\n",
      "superciliously at Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s his name?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What he was christened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\r\n",
      "forgive me, your excellency!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that a tavern at the top there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find\r\n",
      "princesses there too.... La-la!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\r\n",
      "of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\r\n",
      "at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\r\n",
      "conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\r\n",
      "were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\r\n",
      "took a turning to the right in the direction of V.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\r\n",
      "from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\r\n",
      "to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\r\n",
      "feel more so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\r\n",
      "block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\r\n",
      "women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\r\n",
      "indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\r\n",
      "especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\r\n",
      "the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\r\n",
      "tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\r\n",
      "A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\r\n",
      "steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\r\n",
      "soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\r\n",
      "swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\r\n",
      "forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\r\n",
      "drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\r\n",
      "women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\r\n",
      "cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\r\n",
      "not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\r\n",
      "uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\r\n",
      "frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\r\n",
      "and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\r\n",
      "gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\r\n",
      "inquisitively in from the pavement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  “Oh, my handsome soldier\r\n",
      "   Don’t beat me for nothing,”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\r\n",
      "make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\r\n",
      "drunk?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was\r\n",
      "still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\r\n",
      "repulsive--the only one of the group.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you\r\n",
      "just come out of a hospital?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\r\n",
      "noses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\r\n",
      "a loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go along with you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll go, sweetie!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hesitated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\r\n",
      "now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young\r\n",
      "man!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s your name?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ask for Duclida.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head\r\n",
      "at Duclida. “I don’t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should\r\n",
      "drop with shame....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\r\n",
      "of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\r\n",
      "her criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\r\n",
      "an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\r\n",
      "on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,\r\n",
      "everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\r\n",
      "him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\r\n",
      "life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\r\n",
      "at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\r\n",
      "How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\r\n",
      "is he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\r\n",
      "was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\r\n",
      "I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the\r\n",
      "papers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and\r\n",
      "positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\r\n",
      "however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\r\n",
      "room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\r\n",
      "distance. “What if it is?” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\r\n",
      "five days, and I’ll give you something.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\r\n",
      "began to look through them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\r\n",
      "staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\r\n",
      "in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\r\n",
      "Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\r\n",
      "Ah, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to\r\n",
      "read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\r\n",
      "eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\r\n",
      "shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\r\n",
      "sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\r\n",
      "Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\r\n",
      "watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\r\n",
      "smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\r\n",
      "humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\r\n",
      "face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known\r\n",
      "him all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\r\n",
      "unconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\r\n",
      "turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\r\n",
      "irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my\r\n",
      "sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\r\n",
      "you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried\r\n",
      "to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\r\n",
      "would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\r\n",
      "understand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a hot head he is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The explosive one?”\r\n",

      "his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\r\n",
      "steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\r\n",
      "afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\r\n",
      "exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\r\n",
      "suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\r\n",
      "utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\r\n",
      "extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\r\n",
      "moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\r\n",
      "trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\r\n",
      "desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\r\n",
      "them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\r\n",
      "stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\r\n",
      "suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\r\n",
      "leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\r\n",
      "Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\r\n",
      "bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\r\n",
      "everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\r\n",
      "resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.\r\n",
      "“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\r\n",
      "false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\r\n",
      "used to forge tickets!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Of course they are criminals.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\r\n",
      "people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\r\n",
      "many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\r\n",
      "themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\r\n",
      "Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\r\n",
      "a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\r\n",
      "simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\r\n",
      "rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\r\n",
      "life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\r\n",
      "the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\r\n",
      "roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\r\n",
      "but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\r\n",
      "money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\r\n",
      "the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite\r\n",
      "possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t\r\n",
      "stand things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can’t stand that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred\r\n",
      "roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\r\n",
      "into a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\r\n",
      "should not have the face to do it. Would you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers\r\n",
      "kept running down his spine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I\r\n",
      "would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times\r\n",
      "backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the\r\n",
      "second thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some\r\n",
      "fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\r\n",
      "again--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a\r\n",
      "relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\r\n",
      "false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began\r\n",
      "counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a\r\n",
      "mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’\r\n",
      "And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\r\n",
      "so on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the\r\n",
      "fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\r\n",
      "and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew\r\n",
      "that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had\r\n",
      "gone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.\r\n",
      "That’s how I’d do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all\r\n",
      "that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.\r\n",
      "I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\r\n",
      "himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\r\n",
      "woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\r\n",
      "desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\r\n",
      "a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\r\n",
      "place, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov seemed offended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, they will catch him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A\r\n",
      "great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\r\n",
      "no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\r\n",
      "child can mislead you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will\r\n",
      "commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\r\n",
      "drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\r\n",
      "as cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\r\n",
      "behave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\r\n",
      "much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\r\n",
      "bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\r\n",
      "in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what\r\n",
      "I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\r\n",
      "have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\r\n",
      "with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\r\n",
      "or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\r\n",
      "weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\r\n",
      "the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\r\n",
      "to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\r\n",
      "hole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\r\n",
      "would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\r\n",
      "three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d\r\n",
      "be no trace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\r\n",
      "whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\r\n",
      "had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\r\n",
      "He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\r\n",
      "without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\r\n",
      "was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\r\n",
      "his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\r\n",
      "out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said\r\n",
      "suddenly and--realised what he had done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\r\n",
      "face wore a contorted smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\r\n",
      "wrathfully at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried\r\n",

      "“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\r\n",
      "believe less than ever?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been\r\n",
      "frightening me so as to lead up to this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\r\n",
      "back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\r\n",
      "lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the\r\n",
      "waiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he\r\n",
      "held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and\r\n",
      "blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\r\n",
      "clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my\r\n",
      "landlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we\r\n",
      "meet again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\r\n",
      "sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\r\n",
      "was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\r\n",
      "His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\r\n",
      "stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\r\n",
      "quickly when the stimulus was removed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\r\n",
      "thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\r\n",
      "a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\r\n",
      "stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\r\n",
      "till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\r\n",
      "looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\r\n",
      "anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away\r\n",
      "from your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\r\n",
      "went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\r\n",
      "he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\r\n",
      "truth! Confess! Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov answered calmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\r\n",
      "sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\r\n",
      "in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\r\n",
      "for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do\r\n",
      "with you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\r\n",
      "home under my arm and lock you up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\r\n",
      "you see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\r\n",
      "shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\r\n",
      "fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\r\n",
      "was very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\r\n",
      "you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\r\n",
      "torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\r\n",
      "recovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\r\n",
      "went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\r\n",
      "goodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t\r\n",
      "you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\r\n",
      "I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\r\n",

      "He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\r\n",
      "about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\r\n",
      "been with Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\r\n",

      "what a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\r\n",
      "there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\r\n",
      "the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\r\n",
      "leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\r\n",
      "with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\r\n",
      "place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\r\n",
      "over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\r\n",
      "sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\r\n",
      "one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\r\n",
      "the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\r\n",
      "and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\r\n",
      "before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\r\n",
      "banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\r\n",
      "saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\r\n",
      "became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\r\n",
      "and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\r\n",
      "wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\r\n",
      "obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\r\n",
      "right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\r\n",
      "her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\r\n",
      "swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\r\n",
      "woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\r\n",
      "and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\r\n",
      "ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\r\n",
      "crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.\r\n",
      "“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\r\n",
      "boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\r\n",
      "coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\r\n",
      "she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\r\n",
      "her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\r\n",
      "comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\r\n",
      "laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\r\n",
      "consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\r\n",
      "stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed\r\n",
      "at her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\r\n",
      "herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\r\n",
      "girl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,\r\n",
      "gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\r\n",
      "see yonder....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\r\n",
      "mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\r\n",
      "sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s\r\n",
      "loathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.\r\n",
      "“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the\r\n",
      "police office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police\r\n",
      "office is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing\r\n",
      "and looked about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\r\n",
      "walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\r\n",
      "empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\r\n",
      "was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an\r\n",
      "end of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\r\n",
      "along the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But\r\n",
      "is it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of\r\n",
      "space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\r\n",
      "not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\r\n",
      "down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t\r\n",
      "care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\r\n",
      "second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\r\n",
      "first turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a\r\n",
      "side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\r\n",
      "object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\r\n",
      "at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\r\n",
      "his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\r\n",
      "He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\r\n",
      "An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\r\n",
      "house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\r\n",
      "right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\r\n",
      "The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\r\n",
      "and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\r\n",
      "of the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.\r\n",
      "Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\r\n",
      "working. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then\r\n",
      "the third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the\r\n",
      "door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\r\n",
      "he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\r\n",
      "stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\r\n",
      "workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\r\n",
      "would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\r\n",
      "same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\r\n",
      "strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\r\n",
      "were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\r\n",
      "other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\r\n",
      "lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\r\n",
      "some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\r\n",
      "with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\r\n",
      "The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\r\n",
      "hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\r\n",
      "no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "folded his arms and listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very\r\n",
      "early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I\r\n",
      "am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of\r\n",
      "going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously\r\n",
      "regarded the other as an authority.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\r\n",
      "tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\r\n",
      "to dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The\r\n",
      "gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,\r\n",
      "they’re beyond anything you can fancy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried\r\n",
      "enthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder\r\n",
      "declared sententiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\r\n",
      "the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\r\n",
      "tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\r\n",
      "corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\r\n",
      "went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\r\n",
      "bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\r\n",
      "a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\r\n",
      "fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\r\n",
      "vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\r\n",
      "satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to\r\n",
      "him. Raskolnikov went inside again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\r\n",
      "with the porter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\r\n",
      "on. “Is there no blood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What blood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\r\n",
      "perfect pool there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who am I?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The workmen looked at him in amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\r\n",
      "up,” said the elder workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\r\n",
      "out first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the\r\n",
      "gateway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\r\n",
      "the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went straight up to them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you been to the police office?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it open?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is the assistant there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was there for a time. What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which flat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.\r\n",
      "‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’\r\n",
      "And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police\r\n",
      "station,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\r\n",
      "us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\r\n",
      "Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\r\n",
      "knows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\r\n",
      "turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why have you been to the flat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To look at it.”\r\n",

      "“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat\r\n",
      "jerked in abruptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\r\n",
      "same slow, lazy tones:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going\r\n",
      "into _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the\r\n",
      "workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\r\n",
      "in earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant\r\n",
      "in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue\r\n",
      "and no mistake. Get along!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\r\n",
      "lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\r\n",
      "silence and walked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Strange man!” observed the workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the\r\n",
      "man in the long coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular\r\n",
      "rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\r\n",
      "won’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\r\n",
      "of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\r\n",
      "though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\r\n",
      "was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\r\n",
      "him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\r\n",
      "away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\r\n",
      "In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\r\n",
      "middle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right\r\n",
      "and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\r\n",
      "coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\r\n",
      "the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\r\n",
      "spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\r\n",
      "off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\r\n",
      "A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\r\n",
      "of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\r\n",
      "close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\r\n",

      "“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\r\n",
      "in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\r\n",
      "man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\r\n",
      "blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\r\n",
      "flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\r\n",
      "disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\r\n",

      "not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\r\n",
      "else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\r\n",
      "crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\r\n",
      "and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\r\n",
      "straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\r\n",
      "tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\r\n",
      "he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice\r\n",
      "declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\r\n",
      "evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\r\n",
      "was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\r\n",
      "anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\r\n",
      "take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\r\n",
      "his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\r\n",
      "lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a\r\n",
      "government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\r\n",
      "by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He\r\n",
      "pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\r\n",
      "violent agitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\r\n",
      "had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\r\n",
      "Marmeladov to his lodging at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to\r\n",
      "Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\r\n",
      "he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\r\n",
      "daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\r\n",
      "sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will\r\n",
      "be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die\r\n",
      "before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something\r\n",
      "unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward\r\n",
      "and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\r\n",
      "injured man; people volunteered to help.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\r\n",
      "carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\r\n",
      "round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\r\n",
      "moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\r\n",
      "back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\r\n",
      "and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest\r\n",
      "girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not\r\n",
      "understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so\r\n",
      "always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost\r\n",
      "to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little\r\n",
      "brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was\r\n",
      "waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.\r\n",
      "He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,\r\n",
      "serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels\r\n",
      "together and toes turned out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting\r\n",
      "perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good\r\n",
      "little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little\r\n",
      "girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,\r\n",
      "waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve\r\n",
      "them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the\r\n",
      "other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,\r\n",
      "consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner\r\n",
      "during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than\r\n",
      "ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking\r\n",
      "about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house\r\n",
      "and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\r\n",
      "Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\r\n",
      "everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\r\n",
      "as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed\r\n",
      "life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\r\n",
      "breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...\r\n",
      "Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\r\n",
      "and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty\r\n",
      "girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend\r\n",
      "that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\r\n",
      "to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she\r\n",
      "articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\r\n",
      "come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\r\n",
      "make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\r\n",
      "and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your\r\n",
      "father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\r\n",
      "the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you\r\n",
      "must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\r\n",
      "with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\r\n",
      "doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\r\n",
      "he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to\r\n",
      "work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\r\n",
      "What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\r\n",
      "who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are\r\n",
      "they bringing? Mercy on us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov showed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\r\n",
      "children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\r\n",
      "clutched at her, trembling all over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking\r\n",
      "quickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t\r\n",
      "be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been\r\n",
      "here already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\r\n",
      "rushed to her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\r\n",
      "swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a\r\n",
      "pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\r\n",
      "him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\r\n",
      "and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\r\n",
      "doctor, it appeared, next door but one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\r\n",
      "uneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\r\n",
      "anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\r\n",
      "me.... We shall see what the doctor says!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\r\n",
      "corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\r\n",
      "readiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.\r\n",
      "This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\r\n",
      "week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\r\n",
      "were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\r\n",
      "not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\r\n",
      "preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\r\n",
      "the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\r\n",
      "by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,\r\n",
      "but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\r\n",
      "succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\r\n",
      "Marmeladov’s face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\r\n",
      "to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\r\n",
      "to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\r\n",
      "brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you\r\n",
      "don’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\r\n",
      "and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\r\n",
      "there, put on the shawl.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\r\n",
      "which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\r\n",
      "heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have\r\n",
      "dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\r\n",
      "time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\r\n",
      "all Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\r\n",
      "of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\r\n",
      "afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\r\n",
      "fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,\r\n",
      "“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\r\n",
      "cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\r\n",
      "hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\r\n",
      "evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\r\n",
      "another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\r\n",
      "of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\r\n",
      "accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\r\n",
      "no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\r\n",
      "compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\r\n",
      "that they’d no business to make a disturbance here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\r\n",
      "the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\r\n",
      "face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\r\n",
      "and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\r\n",
      "irresponsible German.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken\r\n",
      "horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\r\n",
      " Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\r\n",
      "the landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\r\n",
      "deny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\r\n",
      "not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\r\n",
      "one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing\r\n",
      "behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it\r\n",
      "again’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\r\n",
      "Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\r\n",
      "name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\r\n",
      "he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\r\n",
      "Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\r\n",
      "himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\r\n",
      "me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\r\n",
      "a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\r\n",
      "friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\r\n",
      "pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\r\n",
      "wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\r\n",
      "child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\r\n",
      "but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that\r\n",
      "instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\r\n",
      "ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\r\n",
      "understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\r\n",
      "deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\r\n",
      "and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\r\n",
      "at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said\r\n",
      "in despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov recognised her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A priest,” he articulated huskily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\r\n",
      "frame and exclaimed in despair:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, cursed life!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\r\n",
      "shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\r\n",
      "returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\r\n",
      "long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\r\n",
      "the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\r\n",
      "wondering childish eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\r\n",
      "child’s bare feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\r\n",
      "barefooted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\r\n",
      "him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\r\n",
      "felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\r\n",
      "blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,\r\n",
      "crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\r\n",
      "On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\r\n",
      "yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor\r\n",
      "frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\r\n",
      "turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor\r\n",
      "whispered softly to Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you think of him?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He will die immediately.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there really no hope?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\r\n",
      "too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\r\n",
      "He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Better bleed him then.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\r\n",
      "and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\r\n",
      "the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\r\n",
      "The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\r\n",
      "shoulders and remained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\r\n",
      "understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\r\n",
      "down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\r\n",
      "her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\r\n",
      "little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\r\n",
      "precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\r\n",
      "seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\r\n",
      "lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\r\n",
      "straight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders\r\n",
      "with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\r\n",
      "knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\r\n",
      "opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\r\n",
      "all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\r\n",
      "venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\r\n",
      "came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\r\n",
      "her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the\r\n",
      "street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\r\n",
      "and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\r\n",
      "death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\r\n",
      "the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\r\n",
      "unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\r\n",
      "doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\r\n",
      "She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\r\n",
      "its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\r\n",
      "whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\r\n",
      "with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\r\n",
      "with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\r\n",
      "was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\r\n",
      "terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\r\n",
      "pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\r\n",
      "priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\r\n",
      "words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\r\n",
      "step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\r\n",
      "The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\r\n",
      "consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,\r\n",
      "pointing to the little ones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\r\n",
      "man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\r\n",
      "compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\r\n",
      "“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\r\n",
      "under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\r\n",
      "He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\r\n",
      "wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One\r\n",
      "less to keep!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such\r\n",
      "feelings are a great sin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\r\n",
      "wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\r\n",
      "and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\r\n",
      "she flew at him almost in a frenzy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run\r\n",
      "over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\r\n",
      "in rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\r\n",
      "sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s\r\n",
      "and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\r\n",
      "should have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s\r\n",
      "the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\r\n",
      "to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\r\n",
      "aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\r\n",
      "his head and said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\r\n",
      "of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\r\n",
      "to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\r\n",
      "articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\r\n",
      "wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\r\n",
      "was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\r\n",
      "doorway and he saw Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\r\n",
      "corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\r\n",
      "in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\r\n",
      "daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lie down! Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\r\n",
      "elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\r\n",
      "though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\r\n",
      "Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\r\n",
      "gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\r\n",
      "father. His face showed intense suffering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\r\n",
      "to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\r\n",
      "the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\r\n",
      "was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\r\n",
      "without moving. He died in her arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\r\n",
      "dead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\r\n",
      "I give them to-morrow to eat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his\r\n",
      "life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\r\n",
      "reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\r\n",
      "all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\r\n",
      "friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\r\n",
      "dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\r\n",
      "assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\r\n",
      "be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\r\n",
      "Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\r\n",
      "to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\r\n",
      "Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\r\n",
      "in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,\r\n",
      "all as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is\r\n",
      "in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\r\n",
      "kind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in\r\n",
      "his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\r\n",
      "in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\r\n",
      "then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\r\n",
      "of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\r\n",
      "strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\r\n",
      "compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\r\n",
      "pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\r\n",
      "his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\r\n",
      "with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\r\n",
      "footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\r\n",
      "running after him, calling “Wait! wait!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\r\n",
      "short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "could distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at\r\n",
      "him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\r\n",
      "which she was evidently glad to give.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said\r\n",
      "hurriedly in a breathless voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\r\n",
      "rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\r\n",
      "why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who sent you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\r\n",
      "too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you love sister Sonia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\r\n",
      "earnestness, and her smile became graver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And will you love me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full\r\n",
      "lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\r\n",
      "held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\r\n",
      "wept softly, pressing her face against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her\r\n",
      "tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s\r\n",
      "nothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly\r\n",
      "sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\r\n",
      "like grown-up people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did your father love you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,\r\n",
      "exactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and\r\n",
      "because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\r\n",
      "he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with\r\n",
      "dignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\r\n",
      "liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\r\n",
      "for it’s time my education began.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do you know your prayers?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\r\n",
      "as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\r\n",
      "First they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\r\n",
      "forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\r\n",
      "bless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\r\n",
      "another one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy\r\n",
      "servant Rodion,’ nothing more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared\r\n",
      "hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\r\n",
      "warmly once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\r\n",
      "come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\r\n",
      "ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\r\n",
      "the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with\r\n",
      "fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived\r\n",
      "just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\r\n",
      "Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\r\n",
      "reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\r\n",
      "we will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though\r\n",
      "challenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live\r\n",
      "in a square of space!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\r\n",
      "I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house\r\n",
      "is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\r\n",
      "it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\r\n",
      "satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\r\n",
      "can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s\r\n",
      "what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and\r\n",
      "he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\r\n",
      "self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\r\n",
      "a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\r\n",
      "revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\r\n",
      "straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still\r\n",
      "life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he\r\n",
      "was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\r\n",
      "that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the\r\n",
      "idea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and\r\n",
      "laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\r\n",
      "Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\r\n",
      "upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\r\n",
      "gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\r\n",
      "hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the\r\n",
      "company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\r\n",
      "where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two\r\n",
      "samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\r\n",
      "from the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\r\n",
      "out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\r\n",
      "great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\r\n",
      "drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you\r\n",
      "you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\r\n",
      "him. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\r\n",
      "so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,\r\n",
      "you must...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\r\n",
      "out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps\r\n",
      "he has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he\r\n",
      "is an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But\r\n",
      "confound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh\r\n",
      "air, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\r\n",
      "should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\r\n",
      "you simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you\r\n",
      "imagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the\r\n",
      "way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\r\n",
      "interest in him; soon his face brightened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as\r\n",
      "far as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I\r\n",
      "got it ready some time ago... a powder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to\r\n",
      "Razumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all\r\n",
      "amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”\r\n",
      " Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell\r\n",
      "you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\r\n",
      "to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\r\n",
      "afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head\r\n",
      "that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\r\n",
      "you’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\r\n",
      "you needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\r\n",
      "that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\r\n",
      "diseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your\r\n",
      "conversation to-day with Zametov.”\r\n",

      "drunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this\r\n",
      "idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\r\n",
      "understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\r\n",
      "is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\r\n",
      "bubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\r\n",
      "Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,\r\n",
      "brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed\r\n",
      "he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day\r\n",
      "it’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\r\n",
      "took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\r\n",

      "he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\r\n",
      "understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\r\n",
      "to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\r\n",
      "and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\r\n",
      "time of night, and will do himself some mischief....”\r\n",

      "“What are you saying?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without\r\n",

      "couldn’t find you better lodgings... But you know I’ve had a little to\r\n",
      "drink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\r\n",

      "can’t leave him like that, I cannot!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s\r\n",
      "door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\r\n",
      "extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\r\n",
      "it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\r\n",
      "had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\r\n",
      "had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\r\n",
      "the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\r\n",
      "them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\r\n",
      "word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\r\n",
      "hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\r\n",
      "least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\r\n",
      "his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\r\n",
      "them all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost\r\n",
      "from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\r\n",
      "in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\r\n",
      "was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\r\n",
      "over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\r\n",
      "unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\r\n",
      "see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\r\n",
      "was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her\r\n",
      "brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\r\n",
      "him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\r\n",
      "that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\r\n",
      "however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\r\n",
      "Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\r\n",
      "be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If\r\n",
      "you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and\r\n",
      "then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll\r\n",
      "do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you\r\n",
      "can’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\r\n",
      "way.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of\r\n",
      "an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,\r\n",
      "whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in\r\n",
      "a twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch\r\n",
      "Zossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\r\n",
      "but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him\r\n",
      "to Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the\r\n",
      "hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a\r\n",
      "very different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,\r\n",
      "I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to\r\n",
      "bed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,\r\n",
      "and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which\r\n",
      "is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\r\n",
      "landlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of\r\n",
      "the question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a\r\n",
      "fool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\r\n",
      "too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\r\n",
      "absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\r\n",
      "further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\r\n",
      "the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "did not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\r\n",

      "you knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may\r\n",
      "be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\r\n",
      "am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\r\n",

      "wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint\r\n",

      "I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked\r\n",

      "beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\n",
      "afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter\r\n",
      "warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait\r\n",
      "anxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who\r\n",
      "walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.\r\n",
      "This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya\r\n",

      "daughter’s mood at such moments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation\r\n",

      "people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and\r\n",
      "fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was\r\n",
      "remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,\r\n",
      "strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every\r\n",
      "gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and\r\n",
      "softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\r\n",
      "might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\r\n",
      "little lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost\r\n",
      "black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\r\n",
      "pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\r\n",
      "and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\r\n",
      "a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\r\n",
      "face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\r\n",
      "expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\r\n",
      "but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,\r\n",
      "laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\r\n",
      "simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone\r\n",
      "like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head\r\n",
      "immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the\r\n",
      "first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at\r\n",
      "meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation\r\n",
      "at her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was\r\n",
      "sealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken\r\n",
      "talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric\r\n",
      "landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\n",
      "forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she\r\n",
      "looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the\r\n",
      "case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure\r\n",
      "sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to\r\n",
      "preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her\r\n",
      "hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s\r\n",
      "foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from\r\n",
      "anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia\r\n",
      "over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and\r\n",
      "yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\r\n",
      "great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\r\n",
      "certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions\r\n",
      "which nothing would induce her to cross.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two\r\n",
      "subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was\r\n",
      "opened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may\r\n",
      "sleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I\r\n",
      "came. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d\r\n",
      "better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he ran off down the corridor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some\r\n",
      "warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\r\n",
      "and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely\r\n",
      "relying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\r\n",
      "Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to\r\n",
      "go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest\r\n",
      "suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\r\n",
      "condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\r\n",
      "that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\r\n",
      "minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\r\n",
      "extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\r\n",
      "He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\r\n",
      "slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\r\n",
      "ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\r\n",
      "addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\r\n",
      "extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\r\n",
      "invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\r\n",
      "observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\r\n",
      "material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\r\n",
      "a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and\r\n",
      "moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\r\n",
      "and so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\r\n",
      "words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\r\n",
      "theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\r\n",
      "to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid\r\n",
      "smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\r\n",
      "had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\r\n",
      "was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\r\n",
      "that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\r\n",
      "delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\r\n",
      "a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all\r\n",
      "fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,\r\n",
      "took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\r\n",
      "gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\r\n",
      "with his visit and still more so with himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,\r\n",
      "following Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\r\n",
      "possible with my report.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,\r\n",
      "almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\r\n",
      "and seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?\r\n",
      "Do you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\r\n",
      "him against the wall. “Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he\r\n",
      "had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\r\n",
      "Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but\r\n",
      "still... you are another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked along in silence and only when they were close to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable\r\n",
      "anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other\r\n",
      "failings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You\r\n",
      "are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat\r\n",
      "and lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because\r\n",
      "it leads one straight into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack\r\n",
      "that I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.\r\n",
      "You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your\r\n",
      "patients! In another three or four years you won’t get up for your\r\n",
      "patients... But hang it all, that’s not the point!... You are going\r\n",
      "to spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to\r\n",
      "persuade her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to\r\n",
      "get to know her better.... It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of\r\n",

      "repay you, I’ll do anything....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.\r\n",

      "“Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,\r\n",
      "as long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, too; try curing\r\n",
      "her of something. I swear you won’t regret it. She has a piano, and you\r\n",
      "know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I\r\n",
      "shed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all\r\n",

      "teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m\r\n",

      "Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.\r\n",
      "He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\r\n",
      "He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\r\n",
      "remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\r\n",
      "novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\r\n",
      "unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\r\n",
      "clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\r\n",
      "unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\r\n",
      "he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\r\n",
      "bequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\r\n",
      "himself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but\r\n",
      "because he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse\r\n",
      "her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\r\n",
      "relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\r\n",
      "what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\r\n",
      "Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\r\n",
      "must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\r\n",
      "the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how\r\n",
      "despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\r\n",
      "Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\r\n",
      "truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\r\n",
      "and envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\r\n",
      "him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\r\n",
      "braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\r\n",
      "a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\r\n",
      "suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\r\n",
      "said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\r\n",
      "down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the\r\n",
      "bricks flying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of\r\n",
      "self-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or\r\n",
      "smoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must\r\n",
      "go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask\r\n",
      "forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.\r\n",
      "He hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it\r\n",
      "on. “I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he\r\n",
      "could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend\r\n",
      "the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his\r\n",
      "assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.\r\n",
      "His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he\r\n",
      "washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the\r\n",
      "question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna\r\n",
      "had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question\r\n",
      "was angrily answered in the negative. “Let it stay as it is! What if\r\n",
      "they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think\r\n",
      "so! Not on any account!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the\r\n",
      "manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had\r\n",
      "some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be\r\n",
      "proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all\r\n",
      "the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly\r\n",
      "dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to\r\n",
      "set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d\r\n",
      "make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he\r\n",
      "wouldn’t care! He’d be worse!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night\r\n",
      "in Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.\r\n",
      "Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.\r\n",
      "Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see\r\n",
      "him again about eleven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If he is still at home,” he added. “Damn it all! If one can’t control\r\n",
      "one’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will\r\n",
      "go to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object\r\n",
      "of the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.\r\n",
      "I’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty\r\n",
      "to do besides looking after them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning. “On the way home\r\n",
      "I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and\r\n",
      "amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You told the ladies so, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "seriously?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,\r\n",
      "yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to\r\n",
      "him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with\r\n",
      "your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,\r\n",
      "perhaps, mad on that very point! If only I’d known what happened then\r\n",
      "at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this\r\n",
      "suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.\r\n",
      "These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and\r\n",
      "see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was\r\n",
      "Zametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I\r\n",
      "know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat\r\n",
      "of a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made\r\n",
      "every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police\r\n",
      "officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half\r\n",
      "frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\r\n",
      "may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\r\n",
      "all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\r\n",
      "hm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful\r\n",
      "chatterbox!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But whom did he tell it to? You and me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“What does that matter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?\r\n",
      "Tell them to be more careful with him to-day....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn’t\r\n",
      "seem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose? eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance. “How\r\n",
      "can I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps\r\n",
      "you’ll find out....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine has not gone off\r\n",
      "yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s\r\n",
      "lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through\r\n",
      "the door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her\r\n",
      "from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s\r\n",
      "house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\r\n",
      "had risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\r\n",
      "night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\r\n",
      "had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\r\n",
      "him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\r\n",
      "timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\r\n",
      "moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\r\n",
      "complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\r\n",
      "ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\r\n",
      "confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\r\n",
      "subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\r\n",
      "“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\r\n",
      "beforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\r\n",
      "to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\r\n",
      "they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\r\n",
      "a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\r\n",
      "vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\r\n",
      "in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\r\n",
      "questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\r\n",
      "by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\r\n",
      "most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,\r\n",
      "concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\r\n",
      "however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\r\n",
      "the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\r\n",
      "to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\r\n",
      "listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know\r\n",
      "your name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\r\n",
      "looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\r\n",
      "his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\r\n",
      "what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\r\n",
      "he now? In a word, I should like...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes\r\n",
      "every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\r\n",
      "appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation\r\n",
      "means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\r\n",
      "a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\r\n",
      "late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\r\n",
      "fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\r\n",
      "showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\r\n",
      "heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\r\n",
      "cold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between\r\n",
      "two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\r\n",
      "so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\r\n",
      "nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but\r\n",
      "as though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\r\n",
      "to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\r\n",
      "people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\r\n",
      "he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\r\n",
      "beneficial influence upon him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\r\n",
      "He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\r\n",
      "looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\r\n",
      "attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\r\n",
      "arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\r\n",
      "without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\r\n",
      "what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\r\n",
      "white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\r\n",
      "extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\r\n",
      "like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\r\n",
      "just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\r\n",
      "of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\r\n",
      "afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\r\n",
      "trying for a man who already felt diffident.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s\r\n",
      "character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\r\n",
      "were too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with\r\n",
      "a smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added\r\n",
      "thoughtfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared\r\n",
      "decisively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean he is not capable of love?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\r\n",
      "everything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\r\n",
      "remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\r\n",
      "he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\r\n",
      "slightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\r\n",
      "What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\r\n",
      "supposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\r\n",
      "moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\r\n",
      "he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\r\n",
      "do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\r\n",
      "instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\r\n",
      "me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\r\n",
      "girl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you\r\n",
      "suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\r\n",
      "grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\r\n",
      "disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered\r\n",
      "cautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\r\n",
      "though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\r\n",
      "rather strange.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\r\n",
      "only failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to\r\n",
      "Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\r\n",
      "pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\r\n",
      "queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\r\n",
      "had some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\r\n",
      "either and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always\r\n",
      "difficult to judge in such matters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know\r\n",
      "which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\r\n",
      "or she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\r\n",
      "tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\r\n",
      "Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\r\n",
      "the latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\r\n",
      "caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\r\n",
      "detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\r\n",
      "blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\r\n",
      "seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\r\n",
      "But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\r\n",
      "so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\n",
      "could not resist asking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”\r\n",
      " Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply\r\n",
      "from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\r\n",
      "rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\r\n",
      "mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\r\n",
      "morning I am ashamed of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\r\n",
      "break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\r\n",
      "to speak of Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\r\n",
      "to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\r\n",
      "confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to\r\n",
      "speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this\r\n",
      "morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\r\n",
      "announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\r\n",
      "know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\r\n",
      "lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\r\n",
      "be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\r\n",
      "You’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\r\n",
      "very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\r\n",
      "opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than\r\n",
      "anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\r\n",
      "you, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act\r\n",
      "and I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\r\n",
      "as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\r\n",
      "that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\r\n",
      "the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\r\n",
      "in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\r\n",
      "you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\r\n",
      "delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\r\n",
      "are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\r\n",
      "the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\r\n",
      "not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and\r\n",
      "herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\r\n",
      "request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\r\n",
      "he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\r\n",
      "visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\r\n",
      "from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\r\n",
      "upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\r\n",
      "interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\r\n",
      "that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\r\n",
      "compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\r\n",
      "blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\r\n",
      "ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\r\n",
      "to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\r\n",
      "by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\r\n",
      "was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\r\n",
      "notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\r\n",
      "funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\r\n",
      "raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\r\n",
      "daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\r\n",
      "of\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your humble servant,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“P. LUZHIN.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\r\n",
      "almost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\r\n",
      "so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\r\n",
      "to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\r\n",
      "happen then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at\r\n",
      "once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t\r\n",
      "explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\r\n",
      "it would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\r\n",
      "make a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....\r\n",
      "I didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\r\n",
      "from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\r\n",
      "irritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died\r\n",
      "and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\r\n",
      "money... which...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you\r\n",
      "only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\r\n",
      "was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\r\n",
      "yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand\r\n",
      "a word.... But last night, I myself...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and\r\n",
      "there I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done. Besides,\r\n",
      "it’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at\r\n",
      "a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\r\n",
      "Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\r\n",
      "dress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.\r\n",
      "“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming\r\n",
      "so late. Merciful heavens!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;\r\n",
      "Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\r\n",
      "not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty\r\n",
      "gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\r\n",
      "people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\r\n",
      "at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her\r\n",
      "stockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a\r\n",
      "queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I\r\n",
      "should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith\r\n",
      "in him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”\r\n",
      " exclaimed the poor woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They came out into the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of\r\n",
      "Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took\r\n",
      "my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were\r\n",
      "blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri\r\n",
      "Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.\r\n",
      "Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about\r\n",
      "these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and\r\n",
      "so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a\r\n",
      "relation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the\r\n",
      "matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault\r\n",
      "with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether\r\n",
      "he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,\r\n",
      "you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy\r\n",
      "him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to\r\n",
      "treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t\r\n",
      "ask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the\r\n",
      "stairs.... What an awful staircase!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said\r\n",
      "Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be\r\n",
      "happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they\r\n",
      "reached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her\r\n",
      "door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching\r\n",
      "them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was\r\n",
      "suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\r\n",
      "as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\r\n",
      "fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\r\n",
      "some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\r\n",
      "to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\r\n",
      "day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\r\n",
      "a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\r\n",
      "His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\r\n",
      "little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\r\n",
      "restlessness in his movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\r\n",
      "the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\r\n",
      "pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\r\n",
      "entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\r\n",
      "place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\r\n",
      "of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\r\n",
      "with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\r\n",
      "in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\r\n",
      "bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\r\n",
      "torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\r\n",
      "conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\r\n",
      "at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\r\n",
      "and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\r\n",
      "monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did\r\n",
      "yesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\r\n",
      "his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much\r\n",
      "delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\r\n",
      "up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or\r\n",
      "four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\r\n",
      "as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\r\n",
      "coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\r\n",
      "perhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though\r\n",
      "still afraid of irritating him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete\r\n",
      "recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\r\n",
      "I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\r\n",
      "elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\r\n",
      "morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\r\n",
      "from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must\r\n",
      "be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\r\n",
      "yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\r\n",
      "coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\r\n",
      "occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\r\n",
      "fancy, be very beneficial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\r\n",
      "the university: and then everything will go smoothly....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\r\n",
      "the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\r\n",
      "patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\r\n",
      "an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\r\n",
      "Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\r\n",
      "“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to\r\n",
      "bed before two at home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,\r\n",
      "suddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of\r\n",
      "payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\r\n",
      "really don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\r\n",
      "from you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\r\n",
      "me, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you\r\n",
      "are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\r\n",
      "our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\r\n",
      "love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\r\n",
      "“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\r\n",
      "are you?” shouted Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\r\n",
      "trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\r\n",
      "But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\r\n",
      "her brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though\r\n",
      "repeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have\r\n",
      "been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\r\n",
      "yesterday, waiting for me to come back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\r\n",
      "smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\r\n",
      "unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\r\n",
      "hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\r\n",
      "since their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up\r\n",
      "with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\r\n",
      "reconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,\r\n",
      "exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\r\n",
      "chair. “He has these movements.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What\r\n",
      "generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\r\n",
      "to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\r\n",
      "hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\r\n",
      "fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\r\n",
      "looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\r\n",
      "he’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is\r\n",
      "better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\r\n",
      "I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m\r\n",
      "afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to\r\n",
      "answer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\r\n",
      "that it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\r\n",
      "tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\r\n",
      "you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\r\n",
      "us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\r\n",
      "from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\r\n",
      "streets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the\r\n",
      "tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you\r\n",
      "can’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\r\n",
      "and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out\r\n",
      "till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\r\n",
      "rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\r\n",
      "alone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,\r\n",
      "suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in\r\n",
      "reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\r\n",
      "at him in perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,\r\n",
      "yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean\r\n",
      "to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\r\n",
      "was surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled\r\n",
      "and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\r\n",
      "a lesson?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\r\n",
      "to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\r\n",
      "yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\r\n",
      "over... a clerk...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I\r\n",
      "remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\r\n",
      "that and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes\r\n",
      "performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\r\n",
      "actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s\r\n",
      "like a dream.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed\r\n",
      "Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that\r\n",
      "sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\r\n",
      "slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\r\n",
      "must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\r\n",
      "dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\r\n",
      "his favourite subject, everyone frowned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\r\n",
      "strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”\r\n",
      " Razumihin cried hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with\r\n",
      "blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\r\n",
      "unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\r\n",
      "away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s\r\n",
      "a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\r\n",
      "starving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps\r\n",
      "you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to\r\n",
      "do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\r\n",
      "To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\r\n",
      "chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t\r\n",
      "it, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with\r\n",
      "hatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....\r\n",
      "Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a\r\n",
      "line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\r\n",
      "maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added\r\n",
      "irritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg\r\n",
      "your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”\r\n",
      " said his mother, delighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\r\n",
      "conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\r\n",
      "forgiveness, and all were feeling it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking\r\n",
      "to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through\r\n",
      "his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\n",
      "suddenly blurted out.\r\n",

      "“What Marfa Petrovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about\r\n",
      "her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused\r\n",
      "himself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\r\n",
      "hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending\r\n",
      "you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\r\n",
      "the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\r\n",
      "patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\r\n",
      "married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\r\n",
      "of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\r\n",
      "years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia\r\n",
      "answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\r\n",
      "hurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\r\n",
      "harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\r\n",
      "to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\r\n",
      "told....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“After the beating?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\r\n",
      "to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\r\n",
      "undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\r\n",
      "she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\r\n",
      "into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And did he beat her badly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”\r\n",
      " said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\r\n",
      "her brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\r\n",
      "stairs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His face worked, as though in convulsion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....\r\n",
      "Why did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\r\n",
      "overwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\r\n",
      "train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\r\n",
      "together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\r\n",
      "am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\r\n",
      "now--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\r\n",
      "pressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\r\n",
      "pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\r\n",
      "chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\r\n",
      "him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\r\n",
      "able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\r\n",
      "_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\r\n",
      "for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\r\n",
      "looking at anyone walked towards the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\r\n",
      "all looking at him in perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite\r\n",
      "unexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?\r\n",
      "Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\r\n",
      "Come, anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\r\n",
      "again,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning\r\n",
      "to think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time\r\n",
      "for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made\r\n",
      "his bows, and went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\r\n",
      "had not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my\r\n",
      "illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\r\n",
      "man, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked\r\n",
      "her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much,” answered Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\r\n",
      "confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\r\n",
      "faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are you off to?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.\r\n",
      "What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\r\n",
      "Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I like that sort,” said Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was\r\n",
      "unreasonably delighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\r\n",
      "married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\r\n",
      "by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes, my dear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was\r\n",
      "such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\r\n",
      "“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\r\n",
      "always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\r\n",
      "began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\r\n",
      "well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me\r\n",
      "to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\r\n",
      "lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he\r\n",
      "smiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\r\n",
      "not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\r\n",
      "went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as\r\n",
      "it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\r\n",
      "happening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.\r\n",
      "“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\r\n",
      "but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of\r\n",
      "asking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\r\n",
      "into dreamy silence again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I\r\n",
      "am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so\r\n",
      "melancholy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great\r\n",
      "deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\r\n",
      "what a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing\r\n",
      "strangely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\r\n",
      "with him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\r\n",
      "in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\r\n",
      "would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\r\n",
      "matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\r\n",
      "decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\r\n",
      "escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your\r\n",
      "pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\r\n",
      "I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\r\n",
      "scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\r\n",
      "at once to look on you as a sister.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a\r\n",
      "scoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all\r\n",
      "this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\r\n",
      "and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\r\n",
      "sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\r\n",
      "all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\r\n",
      "me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\r\n",
      "my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\r\n",
      "“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\r\n",
      "haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\r\n",
      "how I... hate them all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\r\n",
      "two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\r\n",
      "me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,\r\n",
      "flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s\r\n",
      "courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\r\n",
      "well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\r\n",
      "again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\r\n",
      "intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\r\n",
      "own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\r\n",
      "with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\r\n",
      "are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.\r\n",
      "“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\r\n",
      "and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\r\n",
      "convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\r\n",
      "proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\r\n",
      "you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\r\n",
      "vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\r\n",
      "Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\r\n",
      "is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\r\n",
      "am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\r\n",
      "so pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\r\n",
      "have fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\r\n",
      "what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\r\n",
      "and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\r\n",
      "took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\r\n",
      "with a sort of wonder at Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What\r\n",
      "am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\r\n",
      "some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\r\n",
      "last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\r\n",
      "slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\r\n",
      "something particular.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\r\n",
      "to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a\r\n",
      "business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\r\n",
      "yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all started. They had expected something quite different.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Yes.”\r\n",

      "Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal\r\n",
      "documents are written like that to this day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\r\n",
      "education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to\r\n",
      "be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\r\n",
      "letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\r\n",
      "annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\r\n",
      "occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\r\n",
      "is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and\r\n",
      "plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\r\n",
      "am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\r\n",
      "you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\r\n",
      "you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\r\n",
      "expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\r\n",
      "written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it\r\n",
      "was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\r\n",
      "in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\r\n",
      "indeed...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\r\n",
      "intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\r\n",
      "in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\r\n",
      "gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\r\n",
      "with trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay\r\n",
      "for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\r\n",
      "of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\r\n",
      "life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\r\n",
      "me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\r\n",
      "jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\r\n",
      "with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\r\n",
      "sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\r\n",
      "don’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\r\n",
      "warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\r\n",
      "awaiting the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\r\n",
      "the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\r\n",
      "surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\r\n",
      "her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\r\n",
      "the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\r\n",
      "a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\r\n",
      "was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\r\n",
      "almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\r\n",
      "somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\r\n",
      "dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\r\n",
      "parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\r\n",
      "much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\r\n",
      "little child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\r\n",
      "recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter\r\n",
      "of “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been\r\n",
      "protesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\r\n",
      "girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\r\n",
      "remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of\r\n",
      "notorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\r\n",
      "his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\r\n",
      "creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\r\n",
      "made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\r\n",
      "stop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "Allow me--not there. Sit here....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\r\n",
      "enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\r\n",
      "Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\r\n",
      "as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\r\n",
      "two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\r\n",
      "could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\r\n",
      "that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she\r\n",
      "began falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\r\n",
      "send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\r\n",
      "the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\r\n",
      "to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\r\n",
      "ceased speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,\r\n",
      "too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\r\n",
      "“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are\r\n",
      "perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and\r\n",
      "he drew up a chair for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\r\n",
      "look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face\r\n",
      "flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\r\n",
      "over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\r\n",
      "her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and\r\n",
      "challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\r\n",
      "gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised\r\n",
      "her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\r\n",
      "her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were\r\n",
      "arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\r\n",
      "they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\r\n",
      "to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\r\n",
      "to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\r\n",
      "herself that it’s necessary...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-day, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\r\n",
      "us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\r\n",
      "controlled herself, looking down again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\r\n",
      "thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\r\n",
      "sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\r\n",
      "her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\r\n",
      "a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\r\n",
      "being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\r\n",
      "peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\r\n",
      "almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\r\n",
      "childishness seemed almost absurd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\r\n",
      "Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,\r\n",
      "persistently keeping up the conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\r\n",
      "it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\r\n",
      "that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\r\n",
      "it should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is\r\n",
      "like that, you know....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\r\n",
      "like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\r\n",
      "loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\r\n",
      "and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\r\n",
      "by Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\r\n",
      "spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\r\n",
      "and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of\r\n",
      "course. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\r\n",
      "walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\r\n",
      "afraid we have exhausted you....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have\r\n",
      "something to see to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in\r\n",
      "surprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\r\n",
      "You do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\r\n",
      "from you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\r\n",
      "with us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please do,” added Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\r\n",
      "strangely embarrassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\r\n",
      "Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\r\n",
      "to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\r\n",
      "out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\r\n",
      "a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\r\n",
      "in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were\r\n",
      "oppressive and painful to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your\r\n",
      "hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\r\n",
      "warmly and awkwardly to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\r\n",
      "brightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to\r\n",
      "live. That is right, isn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\r\n",

      "of that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?\r\n",
      "Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much\r\n",
      "can be forgiven.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,\r\n",
      "hotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You\r\n",
      "are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You\r\n",
      "are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both\r\n",
      "generous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of\r\n",
      "what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”\r\n",

      "a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is\r\n",
      "one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up\r\n",
      "rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will\r\n",
      "crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with\r\n",

      "scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you\r\n",
      "remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that\r\n",

      "She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\r\n",

      "the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\r\n",
      "still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\r\n",
      "started on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "lived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\r\n",
      "upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\r\n",
      "the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\r\n",
      "to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\r\n",
      "something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\r\n",
      "that Sonia was going home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\r\n",
      "same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\r\n",
      "the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\r\n",
      "her and kept two or three yards behind her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\r\n",
      "shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\r\n",
      "good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\r\n",
      "He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\r\n",
      "step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\r\n",
      "with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\r\n",
      "His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\r\n",
      "grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\r\n",
      "His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\r\n",
      "crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\r\n",
      "than his years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\r\n",
      "the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\r\n",
      "the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\r\n",
      "her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\r\n",
      "corner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\r\n",
      "behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\r\n",
      "turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\r\n",
      "in chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,\r\n",
      "wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\r\n",
      "The doors were two or three yards apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\r\n",
      "“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\r\n",
      "Madame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily. “I only came to town the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\r\n",

      "am glad!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...\r\n",
      "was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”\r\n",

      "“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three\r\n",
      "days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\r\n",
      "the things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\r\n",
      "solicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble\r\n",
      "left... after last night’s accursed delirium!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid special emphasis on the delirium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then\r\n",
      "that’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\r\n",
      "were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s\r\n",
      "clear, it’s all clear now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\r\n",
      "go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\r\n",
      "up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\r\n",
      "on all of them!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will\r\n",
      "see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\r\n",
      "manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\r\n",
      "fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\r\n",
      "is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\r\n",
      "rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\r\n",
      "But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\r\n",
      "case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\r\n",
      "anxious to make your acquaintance!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On what grounds is he so anxious?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have\r\n",
      "mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\r\n",
      "your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\r\n",
      "‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\r\n",
      "that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\r\n",
      "the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\r\n",
      "of your exaggerating it, you see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said\r\n",
      "with a constrained smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\r\n",
      "something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried\r\n",
      "with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed\r\n",
      "to speak of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had\r\n",
      "just said about Porfiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a\r\n",
      "beating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the\r\n",
      "most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\r\n",
      "at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\r\n",
      "shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\r\n",
      "thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is\r\n",
      "beating, that’s what’s bad!”\r\n",

      "in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\r\n",
      "writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\r\n",
      "were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\r\n",

      "you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you\r\n",
      "known each other long?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me\r\n",
      "to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out\r\n",
      "without me. Where is your tobacco?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and\r\n",
      "trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,\r\n",
      "stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short\r\n",
      "and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His\r\n",
      "soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,\r\n",
      "but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been\r\n",
      "good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,\r\n",
      "mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression\r\n",
      "of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish\r\n",
      "figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at\r\n",
      "first sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter\r\n",
      "of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down\r\n",
      "himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with\r\n",
      "that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and\r\n",
      "embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are\r\n",
      "discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such\r\n",
      "exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied\r\n",
      "with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,\r\n",
      "sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,\r\n",
      "looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive\r\n",
      "interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a\r\n",
      "most businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of\r\n",
      "the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such\r\n",
      "and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...\r\n",
      "or... but they will write to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried\r\n",
      "his utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and\r\n",
      "even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for\r\n",
      "the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have\r\n",
      "money....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his\r\n",
      "explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you\r\n",
      "prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the\r\n",
      "matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again\r\n",
      "interested in the financial side of the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with\r\n",
      "obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\r\n",
      "him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a\r\n",
      "moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could\r\n",
      "have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little\r\n",
      "disconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them\r\n",
      "particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must\r\n",
      "confess that I was alarmed when I heard...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that\r\n",
      "Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in\r\n",
      "with obvious intention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him\r\n",
      "with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately\r\n",
      "recollected himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a\r\n",
      "well-feigned irritability. “I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious\r\n",
      "about such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,\r\n",
      "and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you\r\n",
      "just now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the\r\n",
      "only thing left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is\r\n",
      "here,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again\r\n",
      "hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the\r\n",
      "watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!”\r\n",
      " shouted Razumihin distressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked\r\n",
      "himself in a tremor. “Why did I say that about women?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When did she come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Last night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry paused as though reflecting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and\r\n",
      "coldly. “I have been expecting you here for some time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered\r\n",
      "the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash\r\n",
      "over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be\r\n",
      "looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”\r\n",
      " cried Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on\r\n",
      "the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the\r\n",
      "date on which you left them with her...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very\r\n",
      "utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly\r\n",
      "added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it\r\n",
      "must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so\r\n",
      "clearly, and... and...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stupid! Feeble!” he thought. “Why did I add that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t\r\n",
      "come forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I haven’t been quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress\r\n",
      "about something. You look pale still.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped\r\n",
      "out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was\r\n",
      "mounting, he could not repress it. “And in my anger I shall betray\r\n",
      "myself,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up. “What next! He was\r\n",
      "unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as\r\n",
      "soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,\r\n",
      "and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,\r\n",
      "delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really delirious? You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a\r\n",
      "womanish way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it anyway,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem\r\n",
      "to catch those strange words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”\r\n",
      " Razumihin got hot suddenly. “What did you go out for? What was the\r\n",
      "object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did\r\n",
      "it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry\r\n",
      "suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to\r\n",
      "take lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with\r\n",
      "me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or\r\n",
      "delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his\r\n",
      "expression and his silence to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were\r\n",
      "extremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had\r\n",
      "been run over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then? You gave your last\r\n",
      "penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen\r\n",
      "or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he\r\n",
      "flung away all the twenty-five at once!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So\r\n",
      "that’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a\r\n",
      "treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour\r\n",
      "with such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with\r\n",
      "trembling lips. “We are boring you, aren’t we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you\r\n",
      "interest me! It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really\r\n",
      "glad you have come forward at last.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "like... something more essential before tea?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on\r\n",
      "ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk\r\n",
      "to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don’t care to hide that they are\r\n",
      "tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was\r\n",
      "shaking with rage. “Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a\r\n",
      "cat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I\r\n",
      "won’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly\r\n",
      "faces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe.\r\n",
      "“And what if it’s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through\r\n",
      "inexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s\r\n",
      "all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is\r\n",
      "something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.\r\n",
      "Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I spoke\r\n",
      "artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin\r\n",
      "is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never\r\n",
      "does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of\r\n",
      "course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset\r\n",
      "my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s ill fancy or they know!\r\n",
      "Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.\r\n",
      "I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s my\r\n",
      "first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back\r\n",
      "to him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they\r\n",
      "were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If\r\n",
      "only they’d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he\r\n",
      "let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use\r\n",
      "afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last\r\n",
      "night! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the\r\n",
      "date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no\r\n",
      "facts... it’s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a\r\n",
      "fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the\r\n",
      "flat? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being\r\n",
      "angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that’s\r\n",
      "right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a\r\n",

      "“What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov\r\n",

      "“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and\r\n",
      "hurried as usual. “Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to\r\n",
      "hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to\r\n",
      "help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist\r\n",
      "doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the\r\n",
      "abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing\r\n",
      "more; no other causes admitted!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them\r\n",
      "is ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. Their favourite\r\n",
      "phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,\r\n",
      "all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest\r\n",
      "against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature\r\n",

      "They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living\r\n",
      "process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a\r\n",
      "social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going\r\n",
      "to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an\r\n",
      "instant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively\r\n",
      "dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they\r\n",
      "explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the _living_\r\n",
      "process of life; they don’t want a _living soul_! The living soul\r\n",
      "demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an\r\n",
      "object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though\r\n",
      "it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not\r\n",
      "alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end\r\n",
      "to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning\r\n",
      "of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,\r\n",
      "indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it\r\n",
      "wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the\r\n",
      "graveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three\r\n",
      "possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce\r\n",
      "it all to the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the\r\n",
      "problem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it. That’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry. “In his article all\r\n",
      "men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have\r\n",
      "to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,\r\n",
      "don’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to\r\n",
      "commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they\r\n",

      "bewilderment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly. “Yet\r\n",
      "I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,\r\n",
      "perfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only\r\n",
      "difference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always\r\n",
      "bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt\r\n",
      "whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an\r\n",
      "‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but\r\n",
      "an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain\r\n",
      "obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment\r\n",
      "of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).\r\n",
      "You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear\r\n",
      "as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I\r\n",
      "maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have\r\n",
      "been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a\r\n",
      "hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have\r\n",
      "been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for\r\n",
      "the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But\r\n",
      "it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people\r\n",
      "right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I\r\n",
      "maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,\r\n",
      "such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without\r\n",
      "exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they\r\n",
      "transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held\r\n",
      "sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,\r\n",
      "if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence\r\n",
      "of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,\r\n",
      "that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity\r\n",
      "were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men\r\n",
      "or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving\r\n",
      "some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,\r\n",
      "of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;\r\n",
      "and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their\r\n",
      "very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to\r\n",
      "it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The\r\n",
      "same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my\r\n",
      "division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that\r\n",
      "it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only\r\n",
      "believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law\r\n",
      "of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\r\n",
      "material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have\r\n",
      "the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,\r\n",
      "innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both\r\n",
      "categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally\r\n",
      "speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live\r\n",
      "under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty\r\n",
      "to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing\r\n",
      "humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the\r\n",
      "law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their\r\n",
      "capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;\r\n",
      "for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the\r\n",
      "present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the\r\n",
      "sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I\r\n",
      "maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading\r\n",
      "through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.\r\n",
      "It’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article\r\n",
      "(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for\r\n",
      "such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,\r\n",
      "they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil\r\n",
      "quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these\r\n",
      "criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or\r\n",
      "less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second\r\n",
      "the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the\r\n",
      "second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal\r\n",
      "right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la\r\n",
      "guerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during\r\n",
      "the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“Literally.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "contrary...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is\r\n",
      "very witty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary\r\n",
      "people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel\r\n",
      "there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the\r\n",
      "natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they\r\n",
      "adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be\r\n",
      "branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of\r\n",
      "one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate\r\n",
      "obstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”\r\n",

      "“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in\r\n",
      "the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps\r\n",
      "unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to\r\n",
      "obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes\r\n",
      "vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,\r\n",
      "‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and\r\n",
      "this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often\r\n",
      "unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling\r\n",
      "tendencies. But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,\r\n",
      "and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,\r\n",
      "they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away\r\n",
      "with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even\r\n",
      "this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very\r\n",
      "conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others\r\n",
      "chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various\r\n",
      "public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying\r\n",
      "effect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of\r\n",
      "nature.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but\r\n",
      "there’s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people\r\n",
      "who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am\r\n",
      "ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming\r\n",
      "if there are a great many of them, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the\r\n",
      "same tone. “People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for\r\n",
      "saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily\r\n",
      "so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these\r\n",
      "grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity\r\n",
      "some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am\r\n",
      "convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of\r\n",
      "mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,\r\n",
      "by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and\r\n",
      "stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a\r\n",
      "thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I\r\n",
      "speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with\r\n",
      "still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius\r\n",
      "is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,\r\n",
      "appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have\r\n",
      "not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there\r\n",
      "certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.\r\n",
      "And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,\r\n",
      "in saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a\r\n",
      "thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is\r\n",
      "exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed\r\n",
      "_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such\r\n",
      "fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that\r\n",

      "really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed\r\n",
      "my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various\r\n",
      "practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth\r\n",
      "imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and\r\n",
      "suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great\r\n",

      "“Yes, you see. Well then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is\r\n",
      "and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\r\n",
      "that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his\r\n",

      "were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\r\n",
      "very well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\r\n",

      "moment he spoke that he need not have said it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as\r\n",
      "possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. “No, I didn’t\r\n",
      "see them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on\r\n",

      "He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting\r\n",
      "his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry\r\n",
      "like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was\r\n",
      "breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his\r\n",
      "unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror\r\n",
      "he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put\r\n",
      "the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the\r\n",
      "hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up\r\n",
      "and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he\r\n",
      "suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper\r\n",
      "in which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,\r\n",
      "might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then\r\n",
      "might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half\r\n",
      "senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went\r\n",
      "quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily\r\n",
      "through the gateway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing\r\n",
      "him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\r\n",
      "and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\r\n",
      "stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\r\n",
      "flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\r\n",
      "they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\r\n",
      "attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\r\n",
      "gate into the street without saying a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\r\n",
      "name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\r\n",
      "he went away. It’s funny.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after\r\n",
      "wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\r\n",
      "him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\r\n",
      "deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\r\n",
      "meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\r\n",
      "At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\r\n",
      "noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\r\n",
      "and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,\r\n",
      "but in a curiously quiet voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both\r\n",
      "silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the\r\n",
      "meaning of it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\r\n",
      "clearly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\r\n",
      "cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\r\n",
      "a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\r\n",
      "they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man did not look at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and\r\n",
      "emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\r\n",
      "straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\r\n",
      "without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\r\n",
      "him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\r\n",
      "standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\r\n",
      "he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\r\n",
      "back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\r\n",
      "and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\r\n",
      "Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\r\n",
      "stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\r\n",
      "images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\r\n",
      "people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\r\n",
      "never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\r\n",
      "in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\r\n",
      "in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\r\n",
      "dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\r\n",
      "Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\r\n",
      "another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\r\n",
      "to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\r\n",
      "within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\r\n",
      "pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\r\n",
      "was an almost pleasant sensation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\r\n",
      "pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\r\n",
      "time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\r\n",
      "the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s\r\n",
      "whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\r\n",
      "door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\r\n",
      "his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\r\n",

      "to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\r\n",
      "was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\r\n",
      "coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\r\n",
      "they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he\r\n",
      "know I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\r\n",
      "gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\r\n",
      "to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\r\n",
      "the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\r\n",
      "once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\r\n",
      "gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\r\n",
      "slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\r\n",
      "familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\r\n",
      "through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\r\n",
      "reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\r\n",
      "at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\r\n",
      "of the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden\r\n",
      "somewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\r\n",
      "stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\r\n",
      "footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\r\n",
      "hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\r\n",
      "hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\r\n",
      "though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\r\n",
      "which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\r\n",
      "chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\r\n",
      "frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\r\n",
      "“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\r\n",
      "silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\r\n",
      "painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\r\n",
      "crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\r\n",
      "flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\r\n",
      "that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\r\n",
      "cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak\r\n",
      "here?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly\r\n",
      "and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\r\n",
      "the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\r\n",
      "double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over\r\n",
      "her. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\r\n",
      "noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\r\n",
      "to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\r\n",
      "frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\r\n",
      "bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\r\n",
      "into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\r\n",
      "woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\r\n",
      "her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\r\n",
      "from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\r\n",
      "whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\r\n",
      "old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\r\n",
      "the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\r\n",
      "woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\r\n",
      "passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\r\n",
      "landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\r\n",
      "heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\r\n",
      "Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\r\n",
      "would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\r\n",
      "his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\r\n",
      "doorway watching him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "again. He lay on his back without stirring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\r\n",
      "perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\r\n",
      "him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\r\n",
      "put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\r\n",
      "and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\r\n",
      "indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\r\n",
      "glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\r\n",
      "whitish beard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\r\n",
      "was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\r\n",
      "Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\r\n",
      "unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\r\n",

      "excited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man\r\n",
      "is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I\r\n",
      "was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch\r\n",
      "afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\r\n",
      "began to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,\r\n",
      "Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’\r\n",
      "she said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if\r\n",
      "I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way\r\n",
      "here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,\r\n",
      "with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and\r\n",
      "there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of\r\n",
      "cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never\r\n",
      "forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,\r\n",
      "besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a\r\n",
      "miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\r\n",
      "Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress\r\n",
      "with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my\r\n",
      "dress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the\r\n",
      "country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a\r\n",
      "pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,\r\n",
      "and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder\r\n",
      "you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good\r\n",
      "gracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her\r\n",
      "I said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,\r\n",
      "Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a\r\n",
      "bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good\r\n",
      "choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you\r\n",
      "will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and\r\n",
      "her train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not\r\n",
      "noticing the rudeness of the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had\r\n",
      "a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my\r\n",
      "pipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat\r\n",
      "still and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a\r\n",
      "violent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole\r\n",
      "in your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,\r\n",
      "and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted\r\n",
      "to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should go to a doctor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know\r\n",
      "what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn’t\r\n",
      "ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you\r\n",
      "believe that they exist.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though\r\n",
      "speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You\r\n",
      "are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not\r\n",
      "strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that\r\n",
      "only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that\r\n",
      "they don’t exist.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him\r\n",
      "deliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with\r\n",
      "it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the\r\n",
      "beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see\r\n",
      "them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the\r\n",
      "sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon\r\n",
      "as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is\r\n",
      "broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the\r\n",
      "more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that\r\n",
      "other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that\r\n",
      "world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you\r\n",
      "could believe in that, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”\r\n",
      " he said suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,\r\n",
      "something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what\r\n",
      "if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black\r\n",
      "and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I\r\n",
      "sometimes fancy it like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than\r\n",
      "that?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know\r\n",
      "it’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a\r\n",
      "vague smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,\r\n",
      "we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\r\n",
      "us; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t\r\n",
      "I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain\r\n",
      "why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,\r\n",
      "I have no time to waste. I want to go out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning\r\n",
      "her name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,\r\n",
      "if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, speak, but make haste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.\r\n",
      "Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only\r\n",
      "seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no\r\n",
      "match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing\r\n",
      "herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of\r\n",
      "her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very\r\n",
      "glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly\r\n",
      "advantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities\r\n",
      "that even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all\r\n",

      "You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\r\n",

      "still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in\r\n",
      "the right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but\r\n",
      "are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking\r\n",
      "to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\r\n",
      "last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d\r\n",
      "brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was\r\n",
      "all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I\r\n",
      "thought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea\r\n",
      "struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger\r\n",
      "or anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We\r\n",
      "shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d\r\n",
      "mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang\r\n",

      "occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he\r\n",
      "thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit\r\n",

      "at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in\r\n",
      "together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men\r\n",
      "walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a\r\n",
      "little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\r\n",
      "forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\r\n",
      "brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with\r\n",
      "redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though\r\n",
      "he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make\r\n",
      "them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a\r\n",
      "cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\r\n",
      "a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to\r\n",
      "insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\r\n",
      "keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp\r\n",
      "and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.\r\n",
      "But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure\r\n",
      "uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so\r\n",
      "openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was\r\n",
      "better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and\r\n",
      "there would always be time for that.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very\r\n",
      "polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,\r\n",
      "directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and\r\n",
      "become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.\r\n",
      "Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had\r\n",
      "nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So\r\n",
      "at least I have excellent authority for believing.”\r\n",

      "“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the\r\n",
      "rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for\r\n",
      "uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting\r\n",
      "into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now\r\n",
      "discovering where he is lodging.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have\r\n",
      "given me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,\r\n",
      "but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the\r\n",
      "cause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I\r\n",
      "do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of\r\n",
      "events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the\r\n",
      "general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am\r\n",
      "in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and\r\n",
      "precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within\r\n",
      "a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any\r\n",
      "pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\r\n",
      "the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.\r\n",
      "I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so\r\n",
      "unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years\r\n",
      "ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions\r\n",
      "and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic\r\n",
      "and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to\r\n",
      "Siberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\r\n",
      "this?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must\r\n",
      "observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.\r\n",
      "There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,\r\n",
      "a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other\r\n",
      "commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close\r\n",
      "and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living\r\n",
      "with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than\r\n",
      "fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she\r\n",
      "used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in\r\n",
      "the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual\r\n",
      "proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that\r\n",
      "the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this\r\n",
      "was not clearly established, the information was given by another German\r\n",
      "woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement\r\n",
      "was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and\r\n",
      "exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very\r\n",
      "significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\r\n",
      "with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\r\n",
      "received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\r\n",
      "to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story\r\n",
      "that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,\r\n",
      "the servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged\r\n",
      "himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not\r\n",
      "his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they\r\n",

      "something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret\r\n",
      "feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that\r\n",
      "others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with\r\n",
      "the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good\r\n",
      "deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he\r\n",
      "considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.\r\n",
      "For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had\r\n",
      "gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound\r\n",
      "secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),\r\n",
      "very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one\r\n",
      "who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who\r\n",
      "would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him\r\n",
      "and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined\r\n",
      "on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,\r\n",
      "behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and\r\n",
      "education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position\r\n",
      "had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he\r\n",
      "dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education\r\n",
      "and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would\r\n",
      "be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and\r\n",
      "would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,\r\n",
      "unbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long\r\n",
      "reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and\r\n",
      "was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his\r\n",
      "cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely\r\n",
      "to be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune\r\n",
      "in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The\r\n",
      "fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make\r\n",
      "his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing\r\n",
      "an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden\r\n",
      "horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a\r\n",
      "hideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,\r\n",
      "had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried\r\n",
      "away--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love\r\n",
      "Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all\r\n",
      "at once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,\r\n",
      "smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop\r\n",
      "who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help\r\n",
      "recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;\r\n",
      "as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man\r\n",
      "he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a\r\n",

      "joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight\r\n",
      "had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to\r\n",
      "them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to\r\n",
      "think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination\r\n",
      "range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and\r\n",
      "indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of\r\n",

      "of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad\r\n",
      "publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give\r\n",
      "a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been\r\n",
      "dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had\r\n",
      "been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages\r\n",

      "there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,\r\n",
      "I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And\r\n",
      "the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants\r\n",
      "translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at\r\n",
      "once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years\r\n",
      "I’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every\r\n",
      "detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe\r\n",

      "the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles\r\n",
      "simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would\r\n",
      "not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you\r\n",
      "think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are\r\n",
      "such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,\r\n",
      "you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go\r\n",

      "grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\r\n",
      "candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\r\n",
      "agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\r\n",
      "rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\r\n",
      "felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\r\n",
      "and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\r\n",
      "Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\r\n",
      "In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\r\n",
      "kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\r\n",
      "Sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\r\n",
      "this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\r\n",
      "out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\r\n",
      "angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\r\n",
      "The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\r\n",
      "furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\r\n",
      "beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\r\n",
      "blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\r\n",
      "flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\r\n",
      "wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\r\n",
      "looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\r\n",
      "room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\r\n",
      "corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\r\n",
      "was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\r\n",
      "unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\r\n",
      "with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\r\n",
      "of her destinies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in\r\n",
      "that lay her means of escape. “My landlady’s clock has just struck... I\r\n",
      "heard it myself....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,\r\n",
      "although this was the first time. “I may perhaps not see you again...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you... going away?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know... to-morrow....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice\r\n",
      "shook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve\r\n",
      "come to say one word....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was\r\n",
      "sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and\r\n",
      "friendly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have always been like that,” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Even when you lived at home?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face\r\n",
      "and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked round him once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They live there, through that door?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... They have another room like this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All in one room?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed\r\n",
      "bewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\r\n",
      "And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They all stammer, don’t they?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not\r\n",
      "exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very\r\n",
      "kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\r\n",
      "children... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others\r\n",
      "are simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear\r\n",
      "about them?” she added with some surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\r\n",
      "went out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "knelt down by your bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was confused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\r\n",
      "o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\r\n",
      "wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were walking in the streets?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\r\n",
      "looking down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with\r\n",
      "dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You love her, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\r\n",
      "clasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!\r\n",
      "You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\r\n",
      "see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\r\n",
      "kind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\r\n",
      "and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\r\n",
      "her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\r\n",
      "she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\r\n",
      "of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\r\n",
      "every feature of her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\r\n",
      "what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\r\n",
      "unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\r\n",
      "she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\r\n",
      "everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\r\n",
      "wouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to\r\n",
      "be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\r\n",
      "good!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what will happen to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked at him inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\r\n",
      "before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\r\n",
      "how will it be now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will they stay there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\r\n",
      "I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia\r\n",
      "was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\r\n",
      "little bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could\r\n",
      "she do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried\r\n",
      "to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she\r\n",
      "is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\r\n",
      "lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\r\n",
      "weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\r\n",
      "wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\r\n",
      "hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\r\n",
      "borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\r\n",
      "set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\r\n",
      "superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\r\n",
      "and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\r\n",
      "her fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been\r\n",
      "washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\r\n",
      "her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\r\n",
      "morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\r\n",
      "quite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly\r\n",
      "enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\r\n",
      "you don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\r\n",
      "shopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "said with a bitter smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him\r\n",
      "again. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d\r\n",
      "seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how\r\n",
      "often, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\r\n",
      "a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,\r\n",
      "I’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were cruel?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,\r\n",
      "‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He\r\n",
      "had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\r\n",
      "there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I\r\n",
      "can’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\r\n",
      "collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself\r\n",
      "in the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,\r\n",
      "Sonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them\r\n",
      "so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\r\n",
      "happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\r\n",
      "has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!\r\n",
      "And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give\r\n",
      "away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\r\n",
      "was sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I\r\n",
      "said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\r\n",
      "me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\r\n",
      "And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\r\n",
      "but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\r\n",
      "change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon\r\n",
      "die,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, no, no!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring\r\n",
      "that she should not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it will be better if she does die.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in\r\n",
      "dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her\r\n",
      "hands to her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and\r\n",
      "he had only roused it again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill\r\n",
      "and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted\r\n",
      "pitilessly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you? That cannot be!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not\r\n",
      "insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will\r\n",
      "be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\r\n",
      "against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\r\n",
      "Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the\r\n",
      "hospital, she will die, and the children...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s\r\n",
      "overburdened bosom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb\r\n",
      "entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.\r\n",
      "Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible\r\n",
      "dejection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping\r\n",
      "suddenly before her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” whispered Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t get money every day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though\r\n",
      "she had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He lets others come to it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort\r\n",
      "of malignance, laughed and looked at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\r\n",
      "him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\r\n",
      "speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is\r\n",
      "unhinged,” he said after a brief silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\r\n",
      "looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\r\n",
      "his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\r\n",
      "face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\r\n",
      "twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\r\n",
      "ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\r\n",
      "certainly he looked like a madman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\r\n",
      "anguish clutched at her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood up at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\r\n",
      "humanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he\r\n",
      "added, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent\r\n",
      "man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister\r\n",
      "honour making her sit beside you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,\r\n",
      "frightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....\r\n",
      "Ah, why did you say that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,\r\n",
      "but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s\r\n",
      "true,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have\r\n",
      "destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t\r\n",
      "it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at\r\n",
      "the same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you\r\n",
      "are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”\r\n",
      " he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist\r\n",
      "in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be\r\n",
      "better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end\r\n",
      "it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with\r\n",
      "eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she\r\n",
      "must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly\r\n",
      "she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that\r\n",
      "now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed\r\n",
      "the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his\r\n",
      "peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,\r\n",
      "and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought\r\n",
      "of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long\r\n",
      "tortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\r\n",
      "her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\r\n",
      "little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and\r\n",
      "the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any\r\n",
      "case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she\r\n",
      "have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,\r\n",
      "since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he\r\n",
      "knew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not\r\n",
      "unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her\r\n",
      "tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\r\n",
      "have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\r\n",
      "up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\r\n",
      "her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her\r\n",
      "heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,\r\n",
      "or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns\r\n",
      "the heart to stone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was\r\n",
      "young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing\r\n",
      "that the last end was the most likely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has\r\n",
      "still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last\r\n",
      "into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have\r\n",
      "begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,\r\n",
      "because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot\r\n",
      "be!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the\r\n",
      "canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\r\n",
      "has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\r\n",
      "mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\r\n",
      "How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she\r\n",
      "is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she\r\n",
      "expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed\r\n",
      "better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,\r\n",
      "glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak\r\n",
      "chest kept heaving with emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking\r\n",
      "sternly and wrathfully at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising\r\n",
      "her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.\r\n",
      "He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft\r\n",
      "blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\r\n",
      "little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\r\n",
      "to him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious\r\n",
      "maniac!” he repeated to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every\r\n",
      "time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.\r\n",
      "It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in\r\n",
      "leather, old and worn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking\r\n",
      "at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who brought it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizaveta! strange!” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every\r\n",
      "moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the\r\n",
      "pages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was\r\n",
      "standing sideways to the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stole a glance at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”\r\n",
      " she whispered sternly, without looking at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down with his elbow on the\r\n",
      "table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to\r\n",
      "listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be\r\n",
      "there if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly\r\n",
      "to the table. She took the book however.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her voice became sterner and sterner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And haven’t you heard it in church?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I... haven’t been. Do you often go?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” whispered Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“For whom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she\r\n",
      "couldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new\r\n",
      "again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read\r\n",
      "to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were\r\n",
      "breathlessly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her\r\n",
      "voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the\r\n",
      "first syllable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced\r\n",
      "herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an\r\n",
      "overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him\r\n",
      "and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on\r\n",
      "her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her\r\n",
      "to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these\r\n",
      "feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps\r\n",
      "for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy\r\n",
      "father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of\r\n",
      "starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same\r\n",
      "time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with\r\n",
      "dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read\r\n",
      "to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of\r\n",
      "it!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.\r\n",
      "She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on\r\n",
      "reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth\r\n",
      "verse:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning\r\n",
      "their brother.\r\n",

      "getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense\r\n",
      "triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the\r\n",
      "department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in\r\n",
      "to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:\r\n",
      "it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected\r\n",
      "that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and\r\n",
      "people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually\r\n",
      "passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an\r\n",
      "office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had\r\n",
      "no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and\r\n",
      "suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some\r\n",
      "mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was\r\n",
      "nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty\r\n",
      "details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.\r\n",
      "He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him\r\n",
      "that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the\r\n",
      "earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait\r\n",
      "like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at\r\n",
      "eleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply\r\n",
      "he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)\r\n",
      "and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom\r\n",
      "exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture\r\n",
      "had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his\r\n",
      "alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh\r\n",
      "conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a\r\n",
      "rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at\r\n",
      "facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was\r\n",
      "meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\r\n",
      "and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such\r\n",
      "that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\r\n",
      "arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\r\n",
      "to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\r\n",
      "nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room\r\n",
      "neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\r\n",
      "stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a\r\n",
      "bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,\r\n",
      "of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,\r\n",
      "beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in\r\n",
      "and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial\r\n",
      "and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had\r\n",
      "been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,\r\n",
      "holding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps\r\n",
      "you don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout\r\n",
      "court_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”\r\n",
      " the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all\r\n",
      "characteristic signs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it\r\n",
      "back in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,\r\n",
      "but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all\r\n",
      "right or shall I copy it again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the\r\n",
      "paper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”\r\n",
      " he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the\r\n",
      "table and put it on his bureau.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...\r\n",
      "formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "was beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through\r\n",
      "his mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I\r\n",
      "believe_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his\r\n",
      "uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the\r\n",
      "first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that\r\n",
      "this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was\r\n",
      "increasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,\r\n",
      "as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,\r\n",
      "at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again\r\n",
      "standing still and looking him straight in the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling\r\n",
      "from one side to the other and rebounding back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a\r\n",
      "cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am\r\n",
      "receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my\r\n",
      "government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to\r\n",
      "have some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government\r\n",
      "quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost\r\n",
      "ironically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as\r\n",
      "though he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital\r\n",
      "thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and\r\n",
      "stopping short two steps from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the\r\n",
      "serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not\r\n",
      "resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him\r\n",
      "and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a\r\n",
      "sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating\r\n",
      "lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least\r\n",
      "an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man\r\n",
      "they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to\r\n",
      "give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t\r\n",
      "that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals\r\n",
      "of the art?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government\r\n",
      "quarters... eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;\r\n",
      "a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his\r\n",
      "forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened\r\n",
      "and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all\r\n",
      "over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced\r\n",
      "himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,\r\n",
      "broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\r\n",
      "stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\r\n",
      "intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on\r\n",
      "both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\r\n",
      "his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\r\n",
      "which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant\r\n",
      "in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\r\n",
      "embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\r\n",
      "fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\r\n",
      "unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\r\n",
      "another moment would break upon him...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\r\n",
      "cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable\r\n",
      "irritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you\r\n",
      "for some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I\r\n",
      "have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow\r\n",
      "me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral\r\n",
      "of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,\r\n",
      "feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at\r\n",
      "his anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s\r\n",
      "partly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase\r\n",
      "about his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine\r\n",
      "me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the\r\n",
      "proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,\r\n",
      "good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”\r\n",
      " cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off\r\n",
      "laughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place\r\n",
      "to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,\r\n",
      "there’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come\r\n",
      "to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for\r\n",
      "my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me\r\n",
      "so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with\r\n",
      "laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m\r\n",
      "often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I\r\n",
      "shall think you are angry...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning\r\n",
      "angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”\r\n",
      " Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding\r\n",
      "his visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence\r\n",
      "and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m\r\n",
      "running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\r\n",
      "our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but\r\n",
      "respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before\r\n",
      "they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit\r\n",
      "opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of\r\n",
      "conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have\r\n",
      "their subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the\r\n",
      "middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied\r\n",
      "and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public\r\n",
      "interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one\r\n",
      "another, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it\r\n",
      "looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so\r\n",
      "delighted...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with\r\n",
      "a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry\r\n",

      "fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is\r\n",

      "moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I\r\n",
      "always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,\r\n",

      "and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...\r\n",
      "I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for\r\n",

      "yourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no\r\n",
      "observation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One\r\n",
      "keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and\r\n",

      "In many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets\r\n",

      "me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining\r\n",

      "deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking\r\n",
      "seriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who\r\n",
      "was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even\r\n",
      "his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m\r\n",
      "a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I\r\n",
      "really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a\r\n",

      "poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable\r\n",
      "to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after\r\n",

      "of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly\r\n",
      "expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special\r\n",
      "case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;\r\n",
      "you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at\r\n",
      "the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course\r\n",
      "there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s\r\n",
      "given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his\r\n",
      "temperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried\r\n",
      "away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he\r\n",
      "will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will\r\n",
      "be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us\r\n",
      "an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think\r\n",
      "differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like\r\n",
      "that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,\r\n",

      "allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long\r\n",

      "laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though\r\n",
      "his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last\r\n",
      "that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister\r\n",
      "Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently\r\n",

      "matter with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "close to Raskolnikov’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\r\n",

      "“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re\r\n",
      "ill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a\r\n",
      "decanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,\r\n",
      "rushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,\r\n",
      "my dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,\r\n",
      "though he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must\r\n",
      "take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me\r\n",
      "yesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they\r\n",
      "made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We\r\n",
      "dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands\r\n",
      "in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\r\n",
      "down!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;\r\n",
      "I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night\r\n",
      "when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so\r\n",
      "that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I\r\n",
      "understand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself\r\n",
      "mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of\r\n",
      "generous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,\r\n",
      "and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to\r\n",
      "another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because\r\n",
      "you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t\r\n",
      "it? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll\r\n",
      "lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such\r\n",
      "a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your\r\n",
      "illness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are\r\n",
      "more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you\r\n",
      "look shocking, do sit down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In\r\n",
      "amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\r\n",
      "still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.\r\n",
      "But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange\r\n",
      "inclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had\r\n",
      "utterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”\r\n",
      " he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a\r\n",
      "case of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to\r\n",
      "murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought\r\n",
      "forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but\r\n",
      "only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that\r\n",
      "he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it\r\n",
      "got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he\r\n",
      "persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court\r\n",
      "of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under\r\n",
      "proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear\r\n",
      "fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse\r\n",
      "to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about\r\n",
      "blood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man\r\n",
      "is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\r\n",
      "same with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You\r\n",
      "have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced\r\n",
      "doctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You\r\n",
      "were delirious when you did all this!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is\r\n",
      "still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling\r\n",
      "to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury\r\n",
      "might drive him mad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining\r\n",
      "every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you\r\n",
      "hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,\r\n",
      "you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell\r\n",
      "me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were\r\n",
      "actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,\r\n",
      "would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession\r\n",
      "of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be\r\n",
      "possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on\r\n",
      "your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\r\n",
      "That’s so, isn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on\r\n",

      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he\r\n",
      "came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t\r\n",
      "conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips\r\n",
      "into a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all\r\n",
      "my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious\r\n",
      "himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to\r\n",
      "frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave\r\n",
      "a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared\r\n",
      "straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined\r\n",
      "gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his\r\n",
      "face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were\r\n",
      "faintly twitching.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,\r\n",
      "slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom\r\n",
      "he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing\r\n",
      "him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them\r\n",
      "tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you\r\n",
      "brought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,\r\n",
      "and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated\r\n",
      "suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\r\n",
      "even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and\r\n",
      "stood immovable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary\r\n",
      "stupefaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was\r\n",
      "obviously bewildered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nikolay again was silent for a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with\r\n",
      "an axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\r\n",
      "moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\r\n",
      "the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.\r\n",
      "Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\r\n",
      "staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\r\n",
      "looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\r\n",
      "seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I\r\n",
      "didn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach! What did you kill them with?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“An axe. I had it ready.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nikolay did not understand the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you do it alone?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs\r\n",
      "like that at the time? The porters met you both!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied\r\n",
      "hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is\r\n",
      "telling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\r\n",
      "on Raskolnikov again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\r\n",
      "forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t\r\n",
      "do; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...\r\n",
      "you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\r\n",
      "not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is\r\n",
      "trembling! He-he!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\r\n",
      "be gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical\r\n",
      "person! Come, till we meet!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\r\n",
      "were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\r\n",
      "whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\r\n",
      "waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\r\n",
      "after him, out of breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,\r\n",
      "but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask\r\n",
      "you... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shan’t we?” he added again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I\r\n",
      "lost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\r\n",
      "that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.\r\n",
      "“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet\r\n",
      "again. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And will get to know each other through and through?” added\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now\r\n",
      "you’re going to a birthday party?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To a funeral.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\r\n",
      "descend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you\r\n",
      "success, but your office is such a comical one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to\r\n",
      "prick up his ears at this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\r\n",
      "psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\r\n",
      "been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\r\n",
      "now that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are\r\n",
      "lying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not\r\n",
      "your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\r\n",
      "not his own tale he was telling?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I help noticing it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a\r\n",
      "playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say\r\n",
      "that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, of Gogol.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So shall I.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\r\n",
      "on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\r\n",
      "collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\r\n",
      "was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\r\n",
      "amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession\r\n",
      "was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\r\n",
      "once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\r\n",
      "would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\r\n",
      "something for himself, for the danger was imminent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\r\n",
      "better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\r\n",
      "him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\r\n",
      "circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\r\n",
      "glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\r\n",
      "bound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\r\n",
      "himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\r\n",
      "nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t\r\n",
      "he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some\r\n",
      "surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting\r\n",
      "something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the\r\n",
      "unexpected appearance of Nikolay?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked\r\n",
      "something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his\r\n",
      "sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was\r\n",
      "that “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have\r\n",
      "concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His\r\n",
      "yesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If\r\n",
      "Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\r\n",
      "his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\r\n",
      "cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\r\n",
      "consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\r\n",
      "wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for\r\n",
      "the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\r\n",
      "and there at once he would see Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a\r\n",
      "moment on to his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must\r\n",
      "be....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He\r\n",
      "started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there\r\n",
      "suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\r\n",
      "and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\r\n",
      "yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\r\n",
      "in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\r\n",
      "his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\r\n",
      "looked exactly like a peasant woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\r\n",
      "still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching\r\n",
      "it with his finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By evil thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They looked at one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go\r\n",
      "to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they\r\n",
      "let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my\r\n",
      "sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\r\n",
      "you....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did, I’ve wronged you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you come from that house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have\r\n",
      "carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare\r\n",
      "hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\r\n",
      "clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had\r\n",
      "been several people there besides the porters, women among them.\r\n",
      "He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\r\n",
      "police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\r\n",
      "now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round\r\n",
      "and made him some answer....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most awful thought\r\n",
      "was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself\r\n",
      "on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell\r\n",
      "nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So\r\n",
      "Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this\r\n",
      "_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more\r\n",
      "facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then\r\n",
      "what can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest\r\n",
      "him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not\r\n",
      "known about it before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck\r\n",
      "by a sudden idea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What Porfiry?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Where? What? When?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "word!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;\r\n",
      "“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not\r\n",
      "come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making\r\n",
      "inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The\r\n",
      "first time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t\r\n",
      "see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of\r\n",
      "everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room\r\n",
      "and punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?\r\n",
      "If I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,\r\n",
      "called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned\r\n",
      "to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I\r\n",
      "told him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word\r\n",
      "in answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he\r\n",
      "fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and\r\n",
      "getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told\r\n",
      "me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. ‘Don’t move,\r\n",
      "whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked\r\n",
      "me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been\r\n",
      "brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you\r\n",
      "again and question you,’ he said.”\r\n",

      "The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\r\n",
      "her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\r\n",
      "as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\r\n",
      "fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\r\n",
      "gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\r\n",
      "jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at\r\n",
      "his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of\r\n",
      "late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\r\n",
      "conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better\r\n",
      "one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned\r\n",
      "aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey\r\n",
      "Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.\r\n",
      "That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\r\n",
      "young friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him\r\n",
      "of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\r\n",
      "have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.\r\n",
      "That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\r\n",
      "and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\r\n",
      "followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\r\n",
      "in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\r\n",
      "which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\r\n",
      "redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\r\n",
      "would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\r\n",
      "been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\r\n",
      "the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\r\n",
      "instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\r\n",
      "flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\r\n",
      "gleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?\r\n",
      "Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\r\n",
      "voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\r\n",
      "and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as\r\n",
      "he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I\r\n",
      "such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\r\n",
      "so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\r\n",
      "foo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\r\n",
      "and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\r\n",
      "all that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position\r\n",
      "would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\r\n",
      "so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\r\n",
      "money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\r\n",
      "do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\r\n",
      "who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a\r\n",
      "blunder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a\r\n",
      "fool--but not aloud, of course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The\r\n",
      "preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\r\n",
      "his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he\r\n",
      "fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares\r\n",
      "he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\r\n",
      "laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\r\n",
      "heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\r\n",
      "lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\r\n",
      "man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\r\n",
      "his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\r\n",
      "important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\r\n",
      "great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\r\n",
      "very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\r\n",
      "she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\r\n",
      "was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\r\n",
      "went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He\r\n",
      "had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\r\n",
      "with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\r\n",
      "had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\r\n",
      "parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\r\n",
      "of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\r\n",
      "progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\r\n",
      "circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\r\n",
      "impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\r\n",
      "despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\r\n",
      "peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\r\n",
      "even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\r\n",
      "heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\r\n",
      "sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\r\n",
      "distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\r\n",
      "many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\r\n",
      "up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\r\n",
      "thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\r\n",
      "this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\r\n",
      "when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\r\n",
      "in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\r\n",
      "had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\r\n",
      "for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\r\n",
      "trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\r\n",
      "subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\r\n",
      "anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger\r\n",
      "generation.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\r\n",
      "his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\r\n",
      "phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\r\n",
      "simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\r\n",
      "had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\r\n",
      "would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\r\n",
      "systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\r\n",
      "him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\r\n",
      "was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\r\n",
      "to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\r\n",
      "precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\r\n",
      "to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\r\n",
      "thing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact\r\n",
      "hundreds of questions presented themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\r\n",
      "flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\r\n",
      "and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\r\n",
      "soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\r\n",
      "speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\r\n",
      "He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\r\n",
      "not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\r\n",
      "really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\r\n",
      "and “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\r\n",
      "and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\r\n",
      "half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in\r\n",
      "fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,\r\n",
      "however sincerely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.\r\n",
      "However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was\r\n",
      "not the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of\r\n",
      "Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\r\n",
      "listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\r\n",
      "instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\r\n",
      "simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\r\n",
      "any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\r\n",
      "third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\r\n",
      "work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he\r\n",
      "would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\r\n",
      "praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\r\n",
      "when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\r\n",

      "his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\r\n",

      "died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your\r\n",
      "late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the\r\n",
      "service at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be\r\n",

      "he-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes\r\n",
      "everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like\r\n",

      "has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots\r\n",
      "or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,\r\n",
      "I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.\r\n",
      "To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of\r\n",

      "question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has\r\n",
      "another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they\r\n",
      "suggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,\r\n",
      "but now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.\r\n",

      "dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,\r\n",
      "there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural\r\n",
      "consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.\r\n",
      "So that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an\r\n",
      "absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of\r\n",
      "it. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now\r\n",
      "I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s\r\n",
      "because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound\r\n",
      "it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived\r\n",
      "in a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a\r\n",
      "despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is\r\n",
      "open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.\r\n",
      "Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you\r\n",
      "incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for\r\n",
      "her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,\r\n",
      "pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\r\n",
      "idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.\r\n",
      "Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s\r\n",
      "funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\r\n",
      "honour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\r\n",
      "and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\r\n",
      "inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\r\n",
      "right “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\r\n",
      "peculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\r\n",
      "their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\r\n",
      "to do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\r\n",
      "probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\r\n",
      "the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\r\n",
      "“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\r\n",
      "to entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\r\n",
      "almost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\r\n",
      "sweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the\r\n",
      "poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\r\n",
      "paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible\r\n",
      "nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\r\n",
      "might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\r\n",
      "been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\r\n",
      "could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her\r\n",
      "mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year\r\n",
      "past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.\r\n",
      "The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the\r\n",
      "intellect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine\r\n",
      "there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\r\n",
      "quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and\r\n",
      "honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of\r\n",
      "pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were\r\n",
      "boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help\r\n",
      "of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been\r\n",
      "stranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before\r\n",
      "running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious\r\n",
      "that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\r\n",
      "her “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\r\n",
      "she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\r\n",
      "“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.\r\n",
      "Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she\r\n",
      "would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance\r\n",
      "and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she\r\n",
      "would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the\r\n",
      "person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She\r\n",
      "was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from\r\n",
      "continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_\r\n",
      "that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the\r\n",
      "peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost\r\n",
      "to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and\r\n",
      "fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against\r\n",
      "the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\r\n",
      "respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart\r\n",
      "and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,\r\n",
      "to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\r\n",
      "kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\r\n",
      "herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the\r\n",
      "table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses\r\n",
      "were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,\r\n",
      "but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and\r\n",
      "a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some\r\n",
      "pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\r\n",
      "some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she\r\n",
      "be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,\r\n",
      "and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!\r\n",
      "Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost\r\n",
      "a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then\r\n",
      "anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been\r\n",
      "allowed into the kitchen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the\r\n",

      "inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down\r\n",
      "and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was\r\n",
      "fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that\r\n",
      "hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except\r\n",
      "the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the\r\n",
      "memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned\r\n",
      "up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older\r\n",
      "and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\r\n",
      "respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\r\n",
      "noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\r\n",
      "been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\r\n",
      "house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\r\n",
      "a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\r\n",
      "motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\r\n",
      "the consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from\r\n",
      "Luzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up\r\n",
      "either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness\r\n",

      "last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\r\n",
      "in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\r\n",
      "back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\r\n",
      "quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\r\n",
      "family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\r\n",

      "foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she\r\n",
      "casually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in\r\n",
      "her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see\r\n",
      "that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to\r\n",
      "make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s\r\n",
      "governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly\r\n",
      "stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he\r\n",
      "was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it\r\n",
      "appeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party\r\n",
      "consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and\r\n",
      "a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt\r\n",
      "abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the\r\n",

      "even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit\r\n",
      "appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought\r\n",
      "with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations\r\n",
      "then?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid\r\n",
      "for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the\r\n",
      "furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with\r\n",
      "increased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with\r\n",
      "special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing\r\n",
      "to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who\r\n",
      "were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the\r\n",

      "knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and\r\n",
      "secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having\r\n",
      "been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and\r\n",
      "made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In\r\n",

      "correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising\r\n",

      "Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\r\n",
      "still more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\r\n",
      "very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\r\n",

      "his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.\r\n",
      "(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these\r\n",
      "Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than\r\n",
      "we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’\r\n",
      "‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing\r\n",
      "the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!\r\n",

      "him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\r\n",
      "before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This\r\n",
      "certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\r\n",
      "with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\r\n",

      "that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\r\n",
      "aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\r\n",
      "certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\r\n",
      "certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\r\n",
      "guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\r\n",
      "contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\r\n",
      "rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\r\n",

      "herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\r\n",
      "teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would\r\n",
      "go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at\r\n",

      "devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\r\n",

      "been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\r\n",

      "laughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting\r\n",

      "Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though\r\n",
      "thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny\r\n",
      "having enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it\r\n",
      "herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too\r\n",
      "by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not\r\n",
      "only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the\r\n",
      "rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some\r\n",
      "matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him\r\n",
      "and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing\r\n",
      "beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not\r\n",
      "seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the\r\n",
      "doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked\r\n",
      "interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of\r\n",
      "some importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company\r\n",
      "generally. “I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful\r\n",
      "attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,”\r\n",
      " he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already\r\n",
      "alarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble\r\n",
      "note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where\r\n",
      "it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to\r\n",
      "witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be\r\n",
      "compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must\r\n",
      "blame yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were\r\n",
      "still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a\r\n",
      "word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at\r\n",
      "last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some\r\n",
      "seconds. “Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,\r\n",
      "as it were, admonishing her. “Reflect, I am prepared to give you time\r\n",
      "for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely\r\n",
      "convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to\r\n",
      "accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before\r\n",
      "witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense\r\n",
      "be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for\r\n",
      "my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of\r\n",
      "approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my\r\n",
      "pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three\r\n",
      "hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.\r\n",
      "About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three\r\n",
      "notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my\r\n",
      "invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly\r\n",
      "embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the\r\n",
      "conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness\r\n",
      "to this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm\r\n",
      "my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in\r\n",
      "order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your\r\n",
      "relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),\r\n",
      "and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a\r\n",
      "subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and\r\n",
      "even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to\r\n",
      "recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest\r\n",
      "detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from\r\n",
      "the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part\r\n",
      "for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then\r\n",
      "I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of\r\n",
      "embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I\r\n",
      "talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I\r\n",
      "returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count\r\n",
      "it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one\r\n",
      "hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.\r\n",
      "Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such\r\n",
      "a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the\r\n",
      "minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the\r\n",
      "total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your\r\n",
      "eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some\r\n",
      "time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position\r\n",
      "and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and\r\n",
      "positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a\r\n",
      "cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in\r\n",
      "spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in\r\n",
      "making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have\r\n",
      "taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing\r\n",
      "to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your\r\n",
      "destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and\r\n",
      "you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too\r\n",
      "bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg\r\n",
      "you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you\r\n",
      "are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten\r\n",
      "roubles, here it is, take it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,\r\n",
      "took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted\r\n",
      "reproachfully, not taking the note.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,\r\n",
      "ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against\r\n",
      "the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” broke from Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore\r\n",
      "I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said\r\n",
      "softly and even kindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason\r\n",
      "before this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to\r\n",
      "remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in\r\n",
      "movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\r\n",
      "she rushed at Luzhin. “What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the\r\n",
      "wretches, the wretches!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as\r\n",
      "in a vise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it\r\n",
      "to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and\r\n",
      "flung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell\r\n",
      "on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "lost his temper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in\r\n",
      "the doorway, among them the two ladies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. “You are an\r\n",
      "idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his\r\n",
      "money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an\r\n",
      "idiot?” she turned from side to side. “And you too?” she suddenly saw\r\n",
      "the landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a\r\n",
      "thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline! She hasn’t been\r\n",
      "out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down\r\n",
      "beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search\r\n",
      "her! Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!\r\n",
      "Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my\r\n",
      "dear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our\r\n",
      "Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,\r\n",
      "to-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do\r\n",
      "you think they wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!\r\n",
      "You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so\r\n",
      "submissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. Search her,\r\n",
      "search her!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards\r\n",
      "Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm\r\n",
      "yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to\r\n",
      "that...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though\r\n",
      "indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in\r\n",
      "any case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with\r\n",
      "the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do\r\n",
      "things.... How is it to be done?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "“Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,\r\n",
      "here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see,\r\n",
      "d’you see?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\r\n",
      "out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\r\n",
      "a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several\r\n",
      "cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\r\n",
      "fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\r\n",
      "hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note\r\n",
      "showing it to everyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "“They must to Siberia be sent! Away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his\r\n",
      "eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\r\n",
      "Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\r\n",
      "surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\r\n",
      "and hid her face in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried\r\n",
      "with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\r\n",
      "her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she\r\n",
      "cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her\r\n",
      "arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\r\n",
      "hands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!\r\n",
      "Oh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,\r\n",
      "“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she\r\n",
      "is! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help\r\n",
      "you if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport\r\n",
      "because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\r\n",
      "husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!\r\n",
      "Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You\r\n",
      "are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend\r\n",
      "her now, at least!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a\r\n",
      "great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,\r\n",
      "the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained\r\n",
      "as a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\r\n",
      "were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried\r\n",
      "impressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an\r\n",
      "instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved\r\n",
      "her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\r\n",
      "idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\r\n",
      "so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\r\n",
      "confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?\r\n",
      "You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how\r\n",
      "could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he\r\n",
      "addressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,\r\n",
      "commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite\r\n",
      "of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a\r\n",
      "lesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will\r\n",
      "carry the matter no further. Enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the\r\n",
      "fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging\r\n",
      "Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on\r\n",
      "all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was\r\n",
      "wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty\r\n",
      "little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the\r\n",
      "face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it\r\n",
      "afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”\r\n",
      " Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though\r\n",
      "seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering. “But what’s the\r\n",
      "matter with you? Are you out of your mind?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard\r\n",
      "everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own\r\n",
      "even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I\r\n",
      "can’t understand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical\r\n",
      "riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch\r\n",
      "vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he\r\n",
      "himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble\r\n",
      "note--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”\r\n",
      " repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin. “She is herself before\r\n",
      "you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her\r\n",
      "only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against\r\n",
      "my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like\r\n",
      "before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only\r\n",
      "like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying\r\n",
      "good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with\r\n",
      "the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I\r\n",
      "saw it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luzhin turned pale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the\r\n",
      "window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You\r\n",
      "are raving!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw\r\n",
      "it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from\r\n",
      "the window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble\r\n",
      "note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,\r\n",
      "you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I\r\n",
      "was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not\r\n",
      "forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand\r\n",
      "all the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting\r\n",
      "up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped\r\n",

      "your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it\r\n",

      "hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people\r\n",
      "are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then\r\n",
      "the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,\r\n",
      "when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you\r\n",
      "wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand\r\n",
      "should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so\r\n",
      "many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it\r\n",
      "indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck\r\n",
      "me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she\r\n",
      "noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of\r\n",

      "from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly\r\n",
      "in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite\r\n",
      "exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech\r\n",
      "produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such\r\n",

      "to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which\r\n",
      "I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your\r\n",
      "valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,\r\n",

      "before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\r\n",
      "and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\r\n",
      "yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\r\n",
      "as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to\r\n",
      "my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\r\n",
      "to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\r\n",
      "contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\r\n",
      "hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you\r\n",
      "understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,\r\n",
      "by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money\r\n",
      "which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,\r\n",
      "before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\r\n",

      "Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\r\n",
      "never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya\r\n",
      "Semyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\r\n",
      "question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I\r\n",
      "answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother\r\n",
      "and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he\r\n",
      "gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took\r\n",
      "place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday\r\n",
      "evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now\r\n",
      "succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would\r\n",
      "have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his\r\n",
      "suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on\r\n",
      "a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting\r\n",
      "and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might\r\n",
      "even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,\r\n",
      "and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing\r\n",
      "of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing\r\n",
      "that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to\r\n",
      "me. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s\r\n",
      "the whole reason for it and there can be no other!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his\r\n",
      "speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by\r\n",
      "exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke\r\n",
      "clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of\r\n",
      "conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\r\n",

      "whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He\r\n",
      "seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have\r\n",
      "been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this\r\n",
      "was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of\r\n",
      "the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had\r\n",
      "already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The\r\n",
      "commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,\r\n",

      "unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came\r\n",
      "in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited\r\n",
      "and were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and\r\n",
      "muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained\r\n",
      "attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as\r\n",
      "though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her\r\n",
      "eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth\r\n",
      "wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.\r\n",

      "contrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing\r\n",
      "the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I\r\n",
      "shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and\r\n",
      "will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and\r\n",
      "atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are\r\n",

      "He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to\r\n",
      "let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished\r\n",
      "it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew\r\n",
      "straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,\r\n",
      "fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room\r\n",
      "and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had\r\n",
      "felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than\r\n",
      "anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that\r\n",
      "moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,\r\n",
      "gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was\r\n",
      "too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without\r\n",
      "murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too\r\n",
      "bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first\r\n",
      "terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all\r\n",
      "clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her\r\n",
      "made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical\r\n",
      "weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room\r\n",
      "and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst\r\n",
      "loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the\r\n",
      "landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\r\n",
      "her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\r\n",
      "floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,\r\n",
      "jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her\r\n",
      "away like a feather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature\r\n",
      "attacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of\r\n",
      "my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,\r\n",
      "with my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and\r\n",
      "gasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice\r\n",
      "upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!\r\n",
      "There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,\r\n",

      "justice on earth!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\r\n",
      "mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\r\n",
      "disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\r\n",
      "wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\r\n",
      "of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little\r\n",
      "ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the\r\n",
      "room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia\r\n",
      "Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing\r\n",
      "everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked\r\n",
      "incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had\r\n",
      "happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others\r\n",
      "struck up a song....\r\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against\r\n",
      "Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\r\n",
      "heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\r\n",
      "of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\r\n",
      "feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\r\n",
      "especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\r\n",
      "with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\r\n",
      "terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\r\n",
      "thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\r\n",
      "superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\r\n",
      "Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he\r\n",
      "felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\r\n",
      "door, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed\r\n",
      "Lizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\r\n",
      "not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\r\n",
      "not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\r\n",
      "only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\r\n",
      "the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\r\n",
      "suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\r\n",
      "doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\r\n",
      "her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\r\n",
      "him as though she were expecting him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting\r\n",
      "him in the middle of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been\r\n",
      "waiting for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she\r\n",
      "had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she\r\n",
      "had done the day before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was\r\n",
      "all due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did\r\n",
      "you understand that just now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her face showed her distress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\r\n",
      "“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I\r\n",
      "wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\r\n",
      "and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she snatched up her cape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.\r\n",
      "“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”\r\n",

      "herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find\r\n",
      "you here, you’ll be blamed for it....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at\r\n",
      "the floor and deliberating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking\r\n",
      "at Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would\r\n",
      "have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.\r\n",
      "Ah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied\r\n",
      "and distressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he\r\n",
      "had intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to\r\n",
      "him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and\r\n",
      "waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It\r\n",
      "was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\r\n",
      "helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\r\n",
      "through Sonia’s heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is\r\n",
      "nonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why\r\n",
      "have I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,\r\n",
      "really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\r\n",
      "before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\r\n",
      "feeling a continual tremor all over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sonia waited uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\r\n",

      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "again after a minute’s pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to her and looked very intently at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shudder passed over her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a\r\n",
      "child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went\r\n",
      "on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\r\n",
      "away. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\r\n",
      "accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\r\n",
      "he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\r\n",
      "flinging himself down from a steeple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no...” whispered Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take a good look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\r\n",
      "heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\r\n",
      "face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s\r\n",
      "face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\r\n",
      "wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\r\n",
      "as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\r\n",
      "looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\r\n",
      "holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\r\n",
      "thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\r\n",
      "terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\r\n",
      "hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\r\n",
      "get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\r\n",
      "even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\r\n",
      "showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\r\n",
      "with the same _childish_ smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\r\n",
      "moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\r\n",
      "and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\r\n",
      "face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\r\n",
      "tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\r\n",
      "there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\r\n",
      "she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\r\n",
      "had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\r\n",
      "instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\r\n",
      "soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\r\n",
      "this very thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\r\n",
      "but this is how it happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\r\n",
      "hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\r\n",
      "down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\r\n",
      "she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\r\n",
      "her knees before him, she did not know why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in\r\n",
      "despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\r\n",
      "round him, and held him tightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\r\n",
      "about that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she\r\n",
      "cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\r\n",
      "violent hysterical weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\r\n",
      "once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\r\n",
      "and hung on his eyelashes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with\r\n",
      "hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow\r\n",
      "you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I\r\n",
      "know you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here I have come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated\r\n",
      "as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to\r\n",
      "Siberia!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\r\n",
      "his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked at him quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\r\n",
      "the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\r\n",
      "seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\r\n",
      "knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\r\n",
      "these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\r\n",
      "believe it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete\r\n",
      "bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,\r\n",
      "you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\r\n",
      "it mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost\r\n",
      "with vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was\r\n",
      "not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s\r\n",
      "not the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia clasped her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\r\n",
      "believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\r\n",
      "rob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry\r\n",
      "yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\r\n",
      "day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\r\n",
      "That money was mine--my own.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any\r\n",
      "money,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her\r\n",
      "neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\r\n",
      "but I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the\r\n",
      "things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\r\n",
      "morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia strained every nerve to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she\r\n",
      "asked quickly, catching at a straw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or\r\n",
      "not,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\r\n",
      "gave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she\r\n",
      "dismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make\r\n",
      "nothing of it, nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell\r\n",
      "you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on\r\n",
      "every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should\r\n",
      "be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he\r\n",
      "cried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to\r\n",
      "you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\r\n",
      "a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you\r\n",
      "to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.\r\n",
      "“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this\r\n",
      "moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\r\n",
      "Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\r\n",
      "thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,\r\n",
      "Sonia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She squeezed his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute\r\n",
      "later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect\r\n",
      "an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\r\n",
      "that. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer\r\n",
      "misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\r\n",
      "Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to\r\n",
      "throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\r\n",
      "you love such a mean wretch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\r\n",
      "instant softened it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\r\n",
      "deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have\r\n",
      "come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s\r\n",
      "not the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused and sank into thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,\r\n",
      "why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I\r\n",
      "should know, far better!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at her with anguish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\r\n",
      "“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\r\n",
      "killed her.... Do you understand now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall\r\n",
      "understand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some\r\n",
      "time lost in meditation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\r\n",

      "without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s\r\n",
      "money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\r\n",
      "to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\r\n",

      "a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\r\n",
      "Well... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\r\n",

      "it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen\r\n",
      "it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp\r\n",
      "the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t\r\n",

      "nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I\r\n",

      "night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for\r\n",
      "candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies\r\n",
      "an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and\r\n",
      "thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange\r\n",

      "that... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept\r\n",
      "asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I\r\n",
      "know they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one\r\n",
      "waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I\r\n",
      "understood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and\r\n",
      "that nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.\r\n",
      "Yes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...\r\n",
      "And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will\r\n",
      "have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their\r\n",
      "eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he\r\n",
      "who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without\r\n",
      "talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his\r\n",
      "faith and code.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only\r\n",
      "vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only\r\n",
      "one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first\r\n",
      "time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever\r\n",
      "thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is\r\n",
      "that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to\r\n",
      "go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted\r\n",
      "_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from\r\n",
      "God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil\r\n",

      "know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all\r\n",
      "over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with\r\n",
      "myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how\r\n",
      "sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it\r\n",
      "and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t\r\n",
      "suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a\r\n",
      "wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that\r\n",
      "I didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether\r\n",
      "I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if\r\n",

      "so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his\r\n",
      "goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,\r\n",
      "wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly\r\n",
      "of course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that\r\n",
      "battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder\r\n",
      "without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t\r\n",
      "want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did\r\n",
      "the murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and\r\n",
      "power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;\r\n",
      "I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a\r\n",
      "benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in\r\n",
      "my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that\r\n",
      "moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It\r\n",
      "was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all\r\n",
      "now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder\r\n",
      "again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led\r\n",
      "me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse\r\n",
      "like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or\r\n",
      "not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling\r\n",

      "but was contemptuously silent. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to\r\n",
      "prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me\r\n",
      "since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such\r\n",
      "a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you\r\n",
      "now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to\r\n",
      "you? Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to\r\n",

      "this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the\r\n",
      "earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought\r\n",
      "I should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,\r\n",
      "I didn’t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning\r\n",
      "from Raskolnikov to Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia screamed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At least it seems so. But... we don’t know what to do, you see! She\r\n",
      "came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps\r\n",
      "beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former\r\n",
      "chief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other\r\n",
      "general’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,\r\n",
      "and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to\r\n",
      "see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what\r\n",
      "happened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own\r\n",
      "story, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe\r\n",
      "it.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand! Now she is\r\n",
      "telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to\r\n",
      "understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,\r\n",
      "she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the\r\n",
      "children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children\r\n",
      "will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every\r\n",
      "day under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born\r\n",
      "children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She\r\n",
      "keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida\r\n",
      "to sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing\r\n",
      "up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means\r\n",
      "to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t\r\n",
      "listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It’s beyond\r\n",
      "anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost\r\n",
      "breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,\r\n",
      "putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov came after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out\r\n",
      "into the street. “I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said\r\n",
      "‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it. They say that in\r\n",
      "consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I\r\n",
      "know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t\r\n",
      "listen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!\r\n",
      "But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he\r\n",
      "has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. That’s clear. Is it your\r\n",
      "conviction that he won’t?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have\r\n",
      "been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the\r\n",
      "insane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific\r\n",
      "man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such\r\n",
      "treatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the\r\n",
      "physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a\r\n",
      "logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He\r\n",
      "gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they\r\n",
      "say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far\r\n",
      "success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at\r\n",
      "least.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he\r\n",
      "lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov\r\n",
      "woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle\r\n",
      "of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered\r\n",
      "paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous\r\n",
      "knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose\r\n",
      "on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of\r\n",
      "absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was\r\n",
      "hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the\r\n",
      "window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out\r\n",
      "of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down\r\n",
      "on the sofa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now\r\n",
      "that he had made her more miserable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison\r\n",
      "her life? Oh, the meanness of it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to\r\n",
      "the prison!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a\r\n",
      "strange thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging\r\n",
      "through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At\r\n",
      "first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he\r\n",
      "had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place\r\n",
      "as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost\r\n",
      "vacantly at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.\r\n",
      "He saw that she too had come to him with love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and\r\n",
      "told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a\r\n",
      "stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that\r\n",
      "there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such\r\n",
      "horror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must\r\n",
      "be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s\r\n",
      "what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t\r\n",
      "judge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having\r\n",
      "blamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,\r\n",
      "should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,\r\n",
      "but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that\r\n",
      "you will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at\r\n",
      "rest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that\r\n",
      "she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began\r\n",
      "to get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or\r\n",
      "anything... call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned abruptly and went towards the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. “That Razumihin,\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia flushed slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....\r\n",
      "Good-bye, Dounia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that\r\n",
      "you... give me such a parting message?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind.... Good-bye.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at\r\n",
      "him uneasily, and went out troubled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)\r\n",
      "when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,\r\n",
      "and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and\r\n",
      "will feel that I stole her kiss.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to\r\n",
      "himself. “No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things! They\r\n",
      "never do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he thought of Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was\r\n",
      "fading. He took up his cap and went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all\r\n",
      "this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And\r\n",
      "if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this\r\n",
      "continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession\r\n",
      "of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had\r\n",
      "begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute\r\n",
      "about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;\r\n",
      "it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a\r\n",
      "foretaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening\r\n",
      "this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or\r\n",
      "something, one can’t help doing something stupid! You’ll go to Dounia,\r\n",
      "as well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she’s\r\n",
      "carried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and\r\n",
      "I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making\r\n",
      "the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the\r\n",
      "cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running\r\n",
      "after them. Come along!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too. But Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They’ll be\r\n",
      "taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....\r\n",
      "They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya\r\n",
      "Semyonovna’s, quite close.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one\r\n",
      "where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally\r\n",
      "of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\r\n",
      "be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\r\n",
      "likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress\r\n",
      "with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way\r\n",
      "on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her\r\n",
      "wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out\r\n",
      "of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\r\n",
      "But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\r\n",
      "more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\r\n",
      "them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began\r\n",
      "explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by\r\n",
      "their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the\r\n",
      "crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she\r\n",
      "immediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,\r\n",
      "one may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard\r\n",
      "laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers\r\n",
      "and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\r\n",
      "heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the\r\n",
      "frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken\r\n",
      "was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\r\n",
      "rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\r\n",
      "when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in\r\n",
      "the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\r\n",
      "which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\r\n",
      "furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\r\n",
      "been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The\r\n",
      "boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.\r\n",
      "There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,\r\n",
      "or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with\r\n",
      "a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.\r\n",
      "Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her\r\n",
      "mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her\r\n",
      "mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly\r\n",
      "frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and\r\n",
      "coughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve\r\n",
      "told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let\r\n",
      "everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,\r\n",
      "though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in\r\n",
      "truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly\r\n",
      "believed it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,\r\n",
      "Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I\r\n",
      "won’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,\r\n",
      "that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their\r\n",
      "living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are\r\n",
      "an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general\r\n",
      "will lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every\r\n",
      "day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children\r\n",
      "before me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the\r\n",
      "father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll\r\n",
      "see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,\r\n",
      "you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What\r\n",
      "are you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with\r\n",
      "such children?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,\r\n",
      "rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried\r\n",
      "to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,\r\n",
      "that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like\r\n",
      "an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a\r\n",
      "boarding-school.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovitch, that\r\n",
      "dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,\r\n",
      "Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing\r\n",
      "in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my\r\n",
      "name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!\r\n",
      "But enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t\r\n",
      "bow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed\r\n",
      "to Sonia. “Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two\r\n",
      "farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after\r\n",
      "us, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing\r\n",
      "at?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya here\r\n",
      "is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?\r\n",
      "Tell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I’ve taught you, you know\r\n",
      "some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well\r\n",
      "brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren’t\r\n",
      "going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel\r\n",
      "song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,\r\n",
      "but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find\r\n",
      "something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,\r\n",
      "as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it\r\n",
      "over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,\r\n",
      "where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed\r\n",
      "at once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and\r\n",
      "everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,\r\n",
      "have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!\r\n",
      "My memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really\r\n",
      "can’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have\r\n",
      "taught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will\r\n",
      "see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much\r\n",
      "more touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’\r\n",
      "for that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the\r\n",
      "aristocratic houses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”\r\n",
      " she began singing. “But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your\r\n",
      "hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other\r\n",
      "way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Cough-cough-cough!) “Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped\r\n",
      "down on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing. “Now it’s\r\n",
      "particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may\r\n",
      "see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice\r\n",
      "should be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,\r\n",
      "with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite\r\n",
      "deformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again! What’s the matter,\r\n",
      "stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that\r\n",
      "moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking\r\n",
      "official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and\r\n",
      "without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore\r\n",
      "a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a\r\n",
      "polite, even ceremonious, bow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily. “The causes that have\r\n",
      "induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and\r\n",
      "honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).\r\n",
      "You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of\r\n",
      "aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating\r\n",
      "grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said,\r\n",
      "‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,\r\n",
      "and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his\r\n",
      "only daughter.’... That policeman again! Protect me,” she cried to the\r\n",
      "official. “Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run\r\n",
      "away from one of them. What do you want, fool?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in\r\n",
      "that way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna. “I buried my husband\r\n",
      "to-day. What need of a license?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official. “Come along;\r\n",

      "at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.\r\n",
      "Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was\r\n",
      "a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for\r\n",

      "first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the\r\n",
      "policeman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling\r\n",
      "that the job was going to be a troublesome one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\r\n",
      "not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\r\n",
      "that stained the pavement red was from her chest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\r\n",
      "even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s\r\n",
      "room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\r\n",
      "flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\r\n",
      "followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\r\n",
      "to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\r\n",
      "were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\r\n",
      "Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\r\n",
      "appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\r\n",
      "wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\r\n",
      "open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\r\n",
      "with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\r\n",
      "noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\r\n",
      "official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\r\n",
      "for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\r\n",
      "for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\r\n",
      "Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\r\n",
      "a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\r\n",
      "bed, supporting her on both sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought\r\n",
      "them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\r\n",
      "looking about her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had\r\n",
      "enough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They laid her back on the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.\r\n",
      "I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have\r\n",
      "suffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\r\n",
      "turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\r\n",
      "but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and\r\n",
      "difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each\r\n",
      "word. “That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,\r\n",

      "forgotten. Remind me! How was it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with a look of growing terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "guest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining\r\n",
      "consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once\r\n",
      "recognised Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though\r\n",
      "surprised to find her there. “Sonia darling, are you here, too?”\r\n",

      "They lifted her up again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!”\r\n",
      " she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the\r\n",
      "pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.\r\n",
      "Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg\r\n",
      "moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless\r\n",
      "with her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw\r\n",
      "herself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though\r\n",
      "Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling\r\n",
      "that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s\r\n",
      "little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened\r\n",
      "their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is dead,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,\r\n",
      "coming up to them.\r\n",

      "and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming\r\n",
      "of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I\r\n",
      "will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she? So\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no\r\n",
      "need of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?\r\n",
      "She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the\r\n",
      "dead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll\r\n",
      "agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\r\n",
      "fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\r\n",
      "was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\r\n",
      "mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\r\n",
      "intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\r\n",
      "mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\r\n",
      "of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\r\n",
      "recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\r\n",
      "other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\r\n",
      "events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\r\n",
      "times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\r\n",
      "to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\r\n",
      "of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\r\n",
      "terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\r\n",
      "seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\r\n",
      "from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\r\n",
      "facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\r\n",
      "to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\r\n",
      "neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\r\n",
      "ruin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be\r\n",
      "permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s\r\n",
      "too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\r\n",
      "break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\r\n",
      "himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\r\n",
      "eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\r\n",
      "come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\r\n",
      "suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\r\n",
      "understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\r\n",
      "outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\r\n",
      "fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another\r\n",
      "time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\r\n",
      "and could not at first understand how he had come there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\r\n",
      "had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\r\n",
      "had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\r\n",
      "reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\r\n",
      "to speak of it for a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was\r\n",
      "busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\r\n",
      "their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\r\n",
      "an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\r\n",
      "hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\r\n",
      "once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\r\n",
      "on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\r\n",
      "orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\r\n",
      "too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that\r\n",
      "there were things they must talk over....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\r\n",
      "dropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\r\n",
      "don’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to\r\n",
      "understand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve\r\n",
      "so much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh\r\n",
      "air... more than anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\r\n",
      "were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\r\n",
      "the priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\r\n",
      "slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\r\n",
      "thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\r\n",
      "and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\r\n",
      "service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\r\n",
      "disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\r\n",
      "coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\r\n",
      "me,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\r\n",
      "the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\r\n",
      "took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\r\n",
      "head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\r\n",
      "repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\r\n",
      "furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\r\n",
      "very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\r\n",
      "would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\r\n",
      "there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\r\n",
      "never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\r\n",
      "the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\r\n",
      "the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\r\n",
      "him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\r\n",
      "made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\r\n",
      "restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\r\n",
      "easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\r\n",
      "listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\r\n",
      "enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\r\n",
      "as though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,\r\n",
      "is that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once\r\n",
      "that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\r\n",
      "requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\r\n",
      "understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the\r\n",
      "struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some\r\n",
      "challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of\r\n",
      "the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\r\n",
      "his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\r\n",
      "up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\r\n",
      "all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\r\n",
      "arrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\r\n",
      "late, two o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\r\n",
      "day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\r\n",
      "some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\r\n",
      "head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\r\n",
      "days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door opened and Razumihin came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair\r\n",
      "and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\r\n",

      "tail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t\r\n",
      "want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\r\n",
      "I shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\r\n",
      "to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is\r\n",
      "a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\r\n",
      "I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\r\n",
      "repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\r\n",

      "couldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\r\n",
      "We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\r\n",
      "while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: ‘If he’s\r\n",
      "gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s\r\n",
      "humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\r\n",
      "kindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.\r\n",
      "‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your\r\n",
      "girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know. I\r\n",
      "went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going\r\n",
      "on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\r\n",
      "apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that’s all\r\n",
      "nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you\r\n",
      "are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had\r\n",
      "a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but\r\n",
      "though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d\r\n",
      "swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,\r\n",
      "for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to\r\n",

      "“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having\r\n",
      "lighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I\r\n",
      "can’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and\r\n",
      "a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to\r\n",
      "Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He\r\n",
      "positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for\r\n",
      "you,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?\r\n",
      "What is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,\r\n",
      "he-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,\r\n",
      "everything is relative!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought\r\n",
      "with disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly\r\n",
      "came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon\r\n",
      "him then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t\r\n",
      "know?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. “I came into\r\n",
      "this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\r\n",
      "I’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\r\n",
      "round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.\r\n",
      "Don’t you lock your door?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess\r\n",
      "his state of mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!\r\n",
      "I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a\r\n",
      "slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\r\n",
      "face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had\r\n",
      "never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.\r\n",
      "Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing\r\n",
      "after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;\r\n",
      "I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and\r\n",
      "your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour\r\n",
      "was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,\r\n",
      "in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we\r\n",
      "came to?... and it was quite indecorous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself\r\n",
      "in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went\r\n",
      "on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to\r\n",
      "disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.\r\n",
      "“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay\r\n",
      "put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That\r\n",
      "damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise\r\n",
      "that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\r\n",
      "afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\r\n",
      "anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What\r\n",
      "shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely\r\n",
      "sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).\r\n",
      "An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,\r\n",
      "Rodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for\r\n",
      "a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,\r\n",
      "anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\r\n",
      "it’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\r\n",
      "which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\r\n",
      "reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\r\n",
      "blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\r\n",
      "man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I was capable of\r\n",
      "realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact\r\n",
      "to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not\r\n",
      "merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get\r\n",
      "something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising\r\n",
      "results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,\r\n",
      "on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that\r\n",
      "time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking\r\n",
      "the question without thinking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really\r\n",
      "take me to be innocent?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my\r\n",
      "duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,\r\n",
      "the whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve caused you a great deal of\r\n",
      "suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what\r\n",
      "it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,\r\n",
      "imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!\r\n",
      "I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without\r\n",
      "elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions.\r\n",
      "I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above\r\n",
      "all I don’t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt\r\n",
      "attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a\r\n",
      "right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no\r\n",
      "reason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do\r\n",
      "all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart\r\n",
      "and conscience. I speak sincerely.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of\r\n",
      "renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent\r\n",
      "began to make him uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch went on. “Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with\r\n",
      "there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to\r\n",
      "me... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions\r\n",
      "were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have\r\n",
      "happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that\r\n",
      "either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I\r\n",
      "admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was\r\n",
      "the first to pitch on you. The old woman’s notes on the pledges and\r\n",
      "the rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.\r\n",
      "I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who\r\n",
      "described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great\r\n",
      "vividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my\r\n",
      "dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a\r\n",
      "hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make\r\n",
      "a proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational\r\n",
      "point of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer\r\n",
      "is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you\r\n",
      "remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the\r\n",
      "time, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,\r\n",
      "you are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest\r\n",
      "and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt\r\n",
      "the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived\r\n",
      "on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed\r\n",
      "enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is\r\n",
      "dangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary\r\n",
      "amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of\r\n",
      "youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your\r\n",
      "article is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,\r\n",
      "a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It’s a\r\n",
      "gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your article and\r\n",
      "put it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’\r\n",
      "Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being\r\n",
      "carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I\r\n",
      "am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is\r\n",
      "there in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing\r\n",
      "and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the thing for\r\n",
      "the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have\r\n",
      "Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what\r\n",
      "you like of it, but it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one\r\n",
      "has to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why am\r\n",
      "I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my\r\n",
      "malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure\r\n",
      "you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the\r\n",
      "time? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,\r\n",
      "not officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was\r\n",
      "searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I\r\n",
      "thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and\r\n",
      "quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Another man wouldn’t,\r\n",
      "but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the\r\n",
      "subject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread\r\n",
      "rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a\r\n",
      "man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by\r\n",
      "your anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant\r\n",
      "‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if\r\n",
      "he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought\r\n",
      "at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over\r\n",
      "and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology\r\n",
      "can be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you\r\n",
      "came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you\r\n",
      "remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you\r\n",
      "so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You\r\n",
      "see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that\r\n",
      "stone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere\r\n",
      "in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and\r\n",
      "afterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking\r\n",
      "your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word\r\n",
      "of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and\r\n",
      "knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what\r\n",
      "I was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if\r\n",
      "you like, and it’s more natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting\r\n",
      "it was more natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some\r\n",
      "little fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my\r\n",
      "breath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and\r\n",
      "I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I would have given a thousand\r\n",
      "roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you\r\n",
      "walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you\r\n",
      "murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question\r\n",
      "all the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your\r\n",
      "bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on\r\n",
      "you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to\r\n",
      "have sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you\r\n",
      "remember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a\r\n",
      "thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn’t believe\r\n",
      "in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;\r\n",
      "and how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making\r\n",
      "very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised\r\n",
      "at him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it is\r\n",
      "to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay\r\n",
      "got to do with it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had\r\n",
      "yourself assured him of it....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in\r\n",
      "indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through\r\n",
      "him, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not\r\n",
      "believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for\r\n",
      "something more definite and conclusive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question\r\n",
      "from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to\r\n",
      "put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is\r\n",
      "not the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me\r\n",
      "with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return\r\n",
      "to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I\r\n",
      "understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not\r\n",
      "exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh\r\n",
      "at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He\r\n",
      "has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells\r\n",
      "stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.\r\n",
      "He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger\r\n",
      "to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at\r\n",
      "times, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,\r\n",
      "without knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it\r\n",
      "up?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There\r\n",
      "have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his\r\n",
      "village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all\r\n",
      "this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he\r\n",
      "wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at\r\n",
      "night, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the\r\n",
      "wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I\r\n",
      "learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see\r\n",
      "him, and now this business came upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can\r\n",
      "one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The\r\n",

      "prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,\r\n",
      "made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of\r\n",
      "the word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of\r\n",
      "suffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they\r\n",
      "suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time\r\n",
      "there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison\r\n",
      "always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself\r\n",
      "crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he\r\n",
      "seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him\r\n",
      "no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side\r\n",
      "on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to\r\n",

      "a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the\r\n",

      "he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for\r\n",
      "him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and\r\n",

      "the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\r\n",
      "the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\r\n",
      "open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\r\n",
      "full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\r\n",
      "violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\r\n",
      "He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,\r\n",
      "when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting\r\n",
      "at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking\r\n",
      "absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.\r\n",
      "His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on\r\n",
      "the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his\r\n",
      "chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\r\n",
      "him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\r\n",
      "same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A\r\n",
      "sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and\r\n",
      "broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the\r\n",
      "window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny\r\n",
      "back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers\r\n",
      "of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\r\n",
      "desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\r\n",
      "could be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\r\n",
      "an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\r\n",
      "also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\r\n",
      "of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\r\n",
      "ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\r\n",
      "servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\r\n",
      "the organ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\r\n",
      "She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\r\n",
      "expression in her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want\r\n",
      "anything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and\r\n",
      "laid down a yellow note.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\r\n",
      "in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he\r\n",
      "allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\r\n",
      "after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\r\n",
      "was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,\r\n",
      "was by now an old friend and very obsequious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at\r\n",
      "home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\r\n",
      "dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\r\n",
      "I don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect\r\n",
      "just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\r\n",
      "Market. And this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.\r\n",
      "It is strange!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because it may be only chance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “You won’t\r\n",
      "admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say\r\n",
      "that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about\r\n",
      "having an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I\r\n",
      "don’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to\r\n",
      "have it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing else?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,\r\n",
      "but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having\r\n",
      "what you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And\r\n",
      "apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\r\n",
      "for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\r\n",
      "is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,\r\n",
      "told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you\r\n",
      "remember?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped\r\n",
      "mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\r\n",
      "precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of\r\n",
      "it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give\r\n",
      "yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I’m\r\n",
      "convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\r\n",
      "as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific\r\n",
      "men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable\r\n",
      "investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places\r\n",
      "where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul\r\n",
      "of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.\r\n",
      "And it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must\r\n",
      "be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\r\n",
      "now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\r\n",
      "of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\r\n",
      "sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\r\n",
      "nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\r\n",
      "talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\r\n",
      "last stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.\r\n",
      "Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.\r\n",
      "It’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,\r\n",
      "you understand me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking\r\n",
      "inquisitively at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, let us leave you alone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me\r\n",
      "twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just\r\n",
      "now when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and\r\n",
      "pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your\r\n",
      "doorway? I saw it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the\r\n",
      "fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a\r\n",
      "full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It\r\n",
      "was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\r\n",
      "with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow\r\n",
      "too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was\r\n",
      "something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so\r\n",
      "wonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light\r\n",
      "summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge\r\n",
      "ring with a precious stone in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. “Even\r\n",
      "though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,\r\n",
      "I don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I\r\n",
      "don’t prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at\r\n",
      "once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister\r\n",
      "and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has\r\n",
      "been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.\r\n",
      "You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the\r\n",
      "second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all\r\n",
      "this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,\r\n",
      "for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question\r\n",
      "you refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. “You\r\n",
      "keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with\r\n",
      "suspicion. Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position. But\r\n",
      "though I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself\r\n",
      "to convince you of the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I\r\n",
      "wasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the\r\n",
      "fantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was! Besides you are\r\n",
      "the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person\r\n",
      "I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I\r\n",
      "gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?\r\n",
      "Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and\r\n",
      "is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me\r\n",
      "not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something\r\n",
      "new. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly\r\n",
      "smile. “Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the\r\n",
      "train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my\r\n",
      "making some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What profit could you make?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all\r\n",
      "my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,\r\n",
      "but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only\r\n",
      "I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a\r\n",
      "terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more.\r\n",
      "I don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch\r\n",
      "anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even\r\n",
      "that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind\r\n",
      "myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a\r\n",
      "peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a\r\n",
      "schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,” he\r\n",
      "pulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s half-past\r\n",
      "four now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry\r\n",
      "officer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,\r\n",
      "and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me\r\n",
      "something new.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what are you, and why have you come here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the\r\n",
      "cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a gambler, I believe?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have been a card-sharper then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It did happen. Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been\r\n",
      "lively.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I\r\n",
      "confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. “What of it? You\r\n",
      "seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you in order,\r\n",
      "first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,\r\n",
      "what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I\r\n",
      "have a passion for them? It’s an occupation, anyway.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway\r\n",
      "I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something\r\n",
      "permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,\r\n",
      "something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever\r\n",
      "setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even\r\n",
      "with years. You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like\r\n",
      "everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must\r\n",
      "exceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way\r\n",
      "or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate\r\n",
      "and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t\r\n",
      "this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent\r\n",
      "man ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And could you shoot yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. “Please don’t speak of\r\n",
      "it,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown\r\n",
      "in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s\r\n",
      "an unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and\r\n",
      "I dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent\r\n",
      "a mystic?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting\r\n",
      "you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound\r\n",
      "them!” he cried with an air of irritation. “Let’s rather talk of that...\r\n",
      "though... H’m! I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,\r\n",
      "it’s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s your engagement, a woman?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk\r\n",
      "of.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t\r\n",
      "that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just\r\n",
      "now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.\r\n",
      "You preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an\r\n",
      "idealist! Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be\r\n",
      "surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,\r\n",
      "what a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,\r\n",
      "by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I\r\n",
      "won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no\r\n",
      "one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when\r\n",
      "I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly\r\n",
      "interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that\r\n",
      "half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. And besides,\r\n",
      "there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that\r\n",
      "I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,\r\n",
      "as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring\r\n",
      "you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about\r\n",
      "myself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a\r\n",
      "woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to\r\n",
      "your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell\r\n",
      "you? It will help to spend the time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that\r\n",
      "I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not\r\n",
      "any expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into\r\n",
      "particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\r\n",
      "point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,\r\n",
      "and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe\r\n",
      "that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and\r\n",
      "reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which\r\n",
      "she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than\r\n",
      "I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There\r\n",
      "was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to\r\n",
      "tell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.\r\n",
      "This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have\r\n",
      "liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to\r\n",
      "deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous\r\n",
      "woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an\r\n",
      "unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never\r\n",
      "leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I\r\n",
      "would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would\r\n",
      "never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her\r\n",
      "secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of\r\n",
      "our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by\r\n",
      "a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On\r\n",
      "this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a\r\n",
      "sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute\r\n",
      "profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous\r\n",
      "woman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble\r\n",
      "came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain\r\n",
      "preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people\r\n",
      "about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than\r\n",
      "in anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was\r\n",
      "ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very\r\n",
      "ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the\r\n",
      "innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that’s enough, I\r\n",
      "think, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife\r\n",
      "of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue\r\n",
      "and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to\r\n",
      "attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were\r\n",
      "times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t\r\n",
      "put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a\r\n",
      "beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that\r\n",
      "Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell\r\n",
      "in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little\r\n",

      "believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first\r\n",
      "for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception\r\n",
      "of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know\r\n",
      "what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of\r\n",
      "telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually\r\n",
      "complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful\r\n",
      "new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were\r\n",

      "feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon\r\n",

      "some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having\r\n",
      "repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip\r\n",
      "about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any\r\n",

      "the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia\r\n",
      "Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure\r\n",
      "martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot\r\n",
      "pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or\r\n",
      "fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and\r\n",
      "would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and\r\n",
      "visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and\r\n",
      "if she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve\r\n",
      "heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;\r\n",
      "his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,\r\n",
      "he’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am\r\n",
      "proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one\r\n",
      "is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it\r\n",
      "all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on\r\n",
      "my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is\r\n",
      "awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you\r\n",
      "this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in\r\n",
      "spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\r\n",
      "happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed\r\n",
      "wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another\r\n",
      "village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,\r\n",
      "wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.\r\n",
      "One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in\r\n",
      "the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha\r\n",
      "alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,\r\n",
      "was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\r\n",
      "embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\r\n",
      "mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\r\n",
      "tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\r\n",
      "propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\r\n",
      "my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\r\n",
      "resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\r\n",
      "female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known\r\n",
      "resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\r\n",
      "truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part\r\n",
      "of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\r\n",
      "leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\r\n",
      "is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\r\n",
      "a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\r\n",
      "flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all\r\n",
      "stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\r\n",
      "seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\r\n",
      "seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\r\n",
      "principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\r\n",
      "had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\r\n",
      "utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\r\n",
      "shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\r\n",
      "the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\r\n",
      "snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\r\n",
      "I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\r\n",
      "I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\r\n",
      "treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\r\n",
      "fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\r\n",
      "innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\r\n",
      "had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\r\n",
      "explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\r\n",
      "just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\r\n",
      "flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\r\n",
      "settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\r\n",
      "now and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now\r\n",
      "that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n",
      "But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\r\n",
      "several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\r\n",
      "the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\r\n",
      "light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\r\n",
      "more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\r\n",
      "but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\r\n",
      "coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\r\n",
      "came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\r\n",
      "tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\r\n",
      "sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\r\n",
      "moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\r\n",
      "I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\r\n",
      "her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\r\n",
      "that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\r\n",
      "be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\r\n",
      "but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\r\n",
      "a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\r\n",
      "anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...\r\n",
      "but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by\r\n",
      "her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you\r\n",
      "are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\r\n",
      "thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\r\n",
      "me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\r\n",
      "rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\r\n",
      "that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\r\n",
      "and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\r\n",
      "the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\r\n",
      "was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\r\n",
      "attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\r\n",
      "really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?\r\n",
      "Wouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you\r\n",

      "no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a\r\n",
      "time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has\r\n",

      "depart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our\r\n",
      "class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down\r\n",
      "retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three\r\n",
      "years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible\r\n",
      "woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;\r\n",
      "there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And\r\n",
      "they’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children\r\n",

      "a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be\r\n",

      "myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,\r\n",
      "with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks\r\n",
      "of that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You\r\n",
      "should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying\r\n",
      "to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,\r\n",
      "still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had\r\n",
      "been told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but\r\n",
      "to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears\r\n",
      "of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little\r\n",
      "picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy\r\n",
      "lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was\r\n",
      "in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is\r\n",
      "the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on\r\n",
      "my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset\r\n",
      "and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that\r\n",
      "this is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The\r\n",
      "present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you\r\n",
      "have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her\r\n",
      "twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that\r\n",

      "sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is\r\n",

      "in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and\r\n",
      "there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\r\n",

      "whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I\r\n",
      "like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,\r\n",
      "‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,\r\n",
      "it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or\r\n",

      "that they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,\r\n",

      "acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their\r\n",
      "own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my\r\n",
      "services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon\r\n",
      "by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to\r\n",
      "assist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was\r\n",

      "struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call\r\n",

      "direction of the Hay Market.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give\r\n",
      "any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that\r\n",

      "to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I\r\n",
      "don’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken\r\n",
      "to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like\r\n",
      "this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter\r\n",

      "coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you\r\n",
      "will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse\r\n",
      "my putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya\r\n",

      "furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,\r\n",
      "for instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of\r\n",
      "almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly\r\n",
      "from the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.\r\n",
      "Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\r\n",
      "the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not\r\n",

      "did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask\r\n",
      "whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from\r\n",
      "asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably\r\n",

      "overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied\r\n",
      "that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He\r\n",
      "has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he\r\n",
      "could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,\r\n",

      "Blood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\r\n",
      "in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\r\n",
      "grazed the skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in\r\n",
      "terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\r\n",
      "she was doing and what was going on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,\r\n",
      "still smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time\r\n",
      "to seize you before you cock again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...\r\n",
      "then.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\r\n",
      "again: it missed fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\r\n",
      "there. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\r\n",
      "determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\r\n",
      "saw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she\r\n",
      "would kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep\r\n",
      "breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\r\n",
      "the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\r\n",
      "It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\r\n",
      "which he could not himself have defined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\r\n",
      "resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\r\n",
      "He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\r\n",
      "utter a sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was\r\n",
      "quite different.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\r\n",
      "he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\r\n",
      "Another moment passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here’s the key.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\r\n",
      "behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take it! Make haste!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\r\n",
      "take the key.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\r\n",
      "quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\r\n",
      "ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\r\n",
      "slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\r\n",
      "strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\r\n",
      "despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\r\n",
      "He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\r\n",
      "The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\r\n",
      "caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket\r\n",
      "three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\r\n",
      "two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\r\n",

      "He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to\r\n",
      "another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\r\n",

      "“villain and tyrant,”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“began kissing Katia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\r\n",
      "the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\r\n",
      "clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\r\n",
      "left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\r\n",
      "garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\r\n",
      "three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\r\n",
      "“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\r\n",
      "served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\r\n",
      "A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\r\n",
      "German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\r\n",
      "clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\r\n",
      "a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\r\n",
      "possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\r\n",
      "that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\r\n",
      "selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\r\n",
      "companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\r\n",
      "belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\r\n",
      "troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\r\n",
      "the garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\r\n",
      "all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\r\n",
      "anything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\r\n",
      "the sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\r\n",
      "came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\r\n",
      "earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\r\n",
      "flash lasted while one could count five.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\r\n",
      "bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\r\n",
      "putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\r\n",
      "but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\r\n",
      "rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\r\n",
      "without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\r\n",
      "was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,\r\n",
      "looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\r\n",
      "once in indescribable terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\r\n",
      "She timidly prepared to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and\r\n",
      "as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\r\n",
      "arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\r\n",
      "you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those\r\n",
      "people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\r\n",
      "brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\r\n",
      "I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\r\n",
      "better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\r\n",
      "them! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\r\n",
      "value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\r\n",
      "yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\r\n",
      "knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\r\n",
      "living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\r\n",
      "need for it now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\r\n",

      "don’t consider...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough! that’s enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,\r\n",

      "ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words\r\n",
      "over it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\r\n",
      "has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked\r\n",
      "wildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from\r\n",
      "himself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice\r\n",
      "when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\r\n",
      "better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\r\n",
      "you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.\r\n",
      "You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\r\n",
      "as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay\r\n",
      "what’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so\r\n",
      "heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\r\n",
      "yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\r\n",
      "You can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned\r\n",
      "about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say\r\n",
      "anything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to\r\n",
      "anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My\r\n",
      "greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money\r\n",
      "for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of\r\n",
      "course you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...\r\n",
      "when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she\r\n",
      "did not dare and did not know how to begin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to\r\n",
      "others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.\r\n",
      "Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure\r\n",
      "to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\r\n",
      "apprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\r\n",
      "he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\r\n",
      "persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\r\n",
      "the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\r\n",
      "Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\r\n",
      "at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be\r\n",
      "very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\r\n",
      "intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had\r\n",
      "probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\r\n",
      "vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\r\n",
      "conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\r\n",
      "question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\r\n",
      "were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\r\n",
      "almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\r\n",
      "by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\r\n",
      "occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\r\n",
      "betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\r\n",
      "had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\r\n",
      "affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\r\n",
      "fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\r\n",
      "him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\r\n",
      "before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\r\n",
      "immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\r\n",
      "purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\r\n",
      "off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\r\n",
      "the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\r\n",
      "other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\r\n",
      "by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,\r\n",
      "laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\r\n",
      "come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\r\n",
      "sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\r\n",
      "he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\r\n",
      "immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\r\n",
      "went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\r\n",
      "the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\r\n",
      "the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was\r\n",
      "a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\r\n",
      "wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\r\n",
      "off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\r\n",
      "there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\r\n",
      "was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\r\n",
      "and all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of\r\n",
      "them and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\r\n",
      "on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\r\n",
      "word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\r\n",
      "the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\r\n",
      "cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\r\n",
      "to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\r\n",
      "whispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\r\n",
      "amazed and rather sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\r\n",
      "way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\r\n",
      "wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\r\n",
      "waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\r\n",
      "But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\r\n",
      "went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\r\n",
      "time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\r\n",
      "wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\r\n",
      "of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\r\n",
      "there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\r\n",
      "large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\r\n",
      "not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\r\n",
      "that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\r\n",
      "blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\r\n",
      "lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\r\n",
      "a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\r\n",
      "scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\r\n",
      "close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\r\n",
      "the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\r\n",
      "looked inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What else is there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Veal, vodka, savouries.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bring me tea and veal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t\r\n",
      "know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have\r\n",
      "had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\r\n",
      "here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\r\n",
      "room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;\r\n",
      "it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\r\n",
      "chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\r\n",
      "were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\r\n",
      "that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\r\n",
      "colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\r\n",
      "by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\r\n",
      "the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\r\n",
      "thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\r\n",
      "in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\r\n",
      "the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\r\n",
      "almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\r\n",
      "light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\r\n",
      "room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\r\n",
      "them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\r\n",
      "in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\r\n",
      "preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\r\n",
      "the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\r\n",
      "declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\r\n",
      "him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\r\n",
      "all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\r\n",
      "air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes\r\n",
      "turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\r\n",
      "the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\r\n",
      "candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\r\n",
      "empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\r\n",
      "of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away\r\n",
      "indifferently and sat down on the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\r\n",
      "him again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a\r\n",
      "negative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a\r\n",
      "glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\r\n",
      "to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\r\n",
      "blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better\r\n",
      "to be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was\r\n",
      "close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\r\n",
      "a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\r\n",
      "leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\r\n",
      "felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden\r\n",
      "under the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike\r\n",
      "the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\r\n",
      "horrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\r\n",
      "Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\r\n",
      "Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have\r\n",
      "liked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled\r\n",
      "again at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and\r\n",
      "comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an\r\n",
      "animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\r\n",
      "to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\r\n",
      "ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\r\n",
      "haven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next\r\n",
      "door,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very\r\n",
      "time and place for you. But now you won’t come!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\r\n",
      "Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\r\n",
      "keeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\r\n",
      "tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a\r\n",
      "good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over\r\n",
      "his nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men\r\n",
      "are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\r\n",
      "himself, it’s nothing to do with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\r\n",
      "and a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he\r\n",
      "thought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer\r\n",
      "and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\r\n",
      "desired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\r\n",
      "sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s\r\n",
      "a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\r\n",
      "But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\r\n",
      "somehow....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image\r\n",
      "rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\r\n",
      "she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\r\n",
      "he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\r\n",
      "to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\r\n",
      "instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\r\n",
      "heart...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\r\n",
      "something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\r\n",
      "started. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the\r\n",
      "veal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\r\n",
      "blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\r\n",
      "his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\r\n",
      "with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\r\n",
      "He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\r\n",
      "He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\r\n",
      "leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\r\n",
      "suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\r\n",
      "instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\r\n",
      "his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\r\n",
      "as before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he\r\n",
      "thought with annoyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\r\n",
      "window. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold\r\n",
      "damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\r\n",
      "blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\r\n",
      "anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\r\n",
      "incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\r\n",
      "mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\r\n",
      "the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\r\n",
      "roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\r\n",
      "on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\r\n",
      "warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\r\n",
      "cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\r\n",
      "flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\r\n",
      "surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\r\n",
      "rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\r\n",
      "particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\r\n",
      "narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\r\n",
      "reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\r\n",
      "into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\r\n",
      "the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\r\n",
      "The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\r\n",
      "were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\r\n",
      "chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\r\n",
      "covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\r\n",
      "covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\r\n",
      "flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\r\n",
      "white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\r\n",
      "though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\r\n",
      "a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\r\n",
      "her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\r\n",
      "pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\r\n",
      "beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\r\n",
      "She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\r\n",
      "herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\r\n",
      "soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\r\n",
      "from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\r\n",
      "a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\r\n",
      "window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\r\n",
      "into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\r\n",
      "his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\r\n",
      "something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\r\n",
      "probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\r\n",
      "rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\r\n",
      "in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\r\n",
      "objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\r\n",
      "gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\r\n",
      "by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the\r\n",
      "signal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be\r\n",
      "swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\r\n",
      "cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\r\n",
      "and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\r\n",
      "it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\r\n",
      "the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once\r\n",
      "straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\r\n",
      "so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\r\n",
      "one’s head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\r\n",
      "into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\r\n",
      "somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\r\n",
      "him for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t\r\n",
      "choose a better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\r\n",
      "anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\r\n",
      "between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\r\n",
      "which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\r\n",
      "girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\r\n",
      "clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\r\n",
      "black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\r\n",
      "crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face\r\n",
      "was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?\r\n",
      "She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning\r\n",
      "her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\r\n",
      "language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and\r\n",
      "about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without\r\n",
      "stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\r\n",
      "neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\r\n",
      "of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\r\n",
      "a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the\r\n",
      "evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\r\n",
      "rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\r\n",
      "spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\r\n",
      "and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\r\n",
      "arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\r\n",
      "her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\r\n",
      "wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\r\n",
      "undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\r\n",
      "the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\r\n",
      "sank into dreary musing again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive\r\n",
      "feeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle\r\n",
      "to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\r\n",
      "“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\r\n",
      "to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\r\n",
      "The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\r\n",
      "and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\r\n",
      "brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush\r\n",
      "of fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\r\n",
      "though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\r\n",
      "hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\r\n",
      "black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\r\n",
      "sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\r\n",
      "girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\r\n",
      "a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\r\n",
      "control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\r\n",
      "a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\r\n",
      "unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\r\n",
      "shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\r\n",
      "turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\r\n",
      "him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\r\n",
      "laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,\r\n",
      "at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does\r\n",
      "it mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\r\n",
      "out her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand\r\n",
      "to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\r\n",
      "been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly\r\n",
      "shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\r\n",
      "see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\r\n",
      "put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\r\n",
      "pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\r\n",
      "pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\r\n",
      "lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\r\n",
      "elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\r\n",
      "flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\r\n",
      "the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\r\n",
      "trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\r\n",
      "At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\r\n",
      "started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\r\n",
      "was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the\r\n",
      "slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\r\n",
      "the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\r\n",
      "the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\r\n",
      "bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\r\n",
      "of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\r\n",
      "The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\r\n",
      "their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\r\n",
      "he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\r\n",
      "each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\r\n",
      "came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\r\n",
      "its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\r\n",
      "drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\r\n",
      "stood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should\r\n",
      "it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\r\n",
      "anyway....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\r\n",
      "there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\r\n",
      "the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\r\n",
      "wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\r\n",
      "head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His\r\n",
      "face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\r\n",
      "printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\r\n",
      "without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\r\n",
      "not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\r\n",
      "word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his\r\n",
      "position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This isn’t the place.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To foreign parts?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To America.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“America.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his\r\n",
      "eyebrows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because it isn’t.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are\r\n",
      "asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put the revolver to his right temple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing\r\n",
      "himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\r\n",
      "his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\r\n",
      "house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\r\n",
      "the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still\r\n",
      "hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:\r\n",
      "his decision was taken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and\r\n",
      "they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a\r\n",
      "night’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\r\n",
      "inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\r\n",
      "the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a\r\n",
      "decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not\r\n",
      "at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by\r\n",
      "the hand and drew him into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with\r\n",
      "me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not\r\n",
      "crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got\r\n",

      "When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day\r\n",
      "Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been\r\n",
      "waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the\r\n",
      "conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.\r\n",
      "Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her\r\n",
      "brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his\r\n",
      "confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;\r\n",
      "she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,\r\n",
      "but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and\r\n",
      "at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point\r\n",
      "of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at\r\n",
      "Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively\r\n",
      "and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had\r\n",
      "remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her\r\n",
      "brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come\r\n",
      "there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread\r\n",
      "of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent\r\n",
      "the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\r\n",
      "were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\r\n",
      "thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to\r\n",
      "her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...\r\n",
      "Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to\r\n",
      "make him live?” she thought at last in despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking\r\n",
      "intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the\r\n",
      "unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to\r\n",
      "feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned\r\n",
      "pale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It\r\n",

      "now it’s come to that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold\r\n",
      "shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the\r\n",
      "words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid\r\n",
      "meeting her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one\r\n",

      "rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise\r\n",
      "him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become\r\n",
      "too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my\r\n",
      "sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s\r\n",
      "a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the\r\n",
      "crosses?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or\r\n",

      "one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress\r\n",
      "wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and\r\n",
      "over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I\r\n",
      "had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant\r\n",
      "one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show\r\n",
      "me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like\r\n",
      "these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old\r\n",
      "woman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I\r\n",
      "ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what\r\n",
      "matters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,\r\n",
      "Sonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But\r\n",
      "I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\r\n",
      "am going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying\r\n",
      "for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why\r\n",
      "is she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does\r\n",
      "she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll\r\n",

      "“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he wanted to say something quite different.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put\r\n",
      "it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which\r\n",
      "Marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\r\n",
      "looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he\r\n",
      "was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was\r\n",
      "frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia\r\n",
      "meant to go with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go\r\n",
      "alone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved\r\n",
      "towards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered\r\n",
      "going out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said\r\n",
      "good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt\r\n",
      "surged in his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down\r\n",
      "the stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask\r\n",
      "himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he\r\n",
      "had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of\r\n",
      "the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted\r\n",
      "at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another\r\n",
      "thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\r\n",
      "him then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on\r\n",

      "_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away\r\n",
      "just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,\r\n",
      "I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart\r\n",
      "ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some\r\n",
      "friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what\r\n",

      "He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But\r\n",
      "on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and\r\n",
      "could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In\r\n",
      "another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this\r\n",

      "this!” slipped into his mind. “Look at this sign! How shall I read those\r\n",
      "letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,\r\n",
      "that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look\r\n",
      "at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial\r\n",
      "it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be\r\n",
      "interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am\r\n",
      "becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how\r\n",
      "people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against\r\n",
      "me, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,\r\n",
      "begging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might\r\n",
      "give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck\r\n",
      "piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my\r\n",
      "good woman!”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be\r\n",
      "in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have\r\n",
      "given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he\r\n",
      "would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and\r\n",
      "disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There\r\n",
      "was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,\r\n",
      "stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short\r\n",
      "jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,\r\n",
      "though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he\r\n",
      "was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly\r\n",
      "came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to\r\n",
      "the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say\r\n",
      "aloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering\r\n",
      "that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially\r\n",
      "of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\r\n",
      "clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\r\n",
      "over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and\r\n",
      "spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the\r\n",
      "tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and\r\n",
      "kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed\r\n",
      "down a second time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a roar of laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children\r\n",
      "and his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great\r\n",
      "city of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a\r\n",
      "little drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\r\n",
      "a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\r\n",
      "died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking\r\n",
      "round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\r\n",
      "glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\r\n",
      "that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he\r\n",
      "saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding\r\n",
      "from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had\r\n",
      "followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt\r\n",
      "and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow\r\n",
      "him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his\r\n",
      "heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third\r\n",
      "storey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though\r\n",
      "the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time\r\n",
      "left for consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral\r\n",
      "stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\r\n",
      "the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been\r\n",
      "here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\r\n",
      "still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\r\n",
      "collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he\r\n",
      "wondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it\r\n",
      "make? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the\r\n",
      "figure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually\r\n",
      "going to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?\r\n",
      "Couldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?\r\n",
      "At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive\r\n",
      "lieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.\r\n",
      "There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a\r\n",
      "peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”\r\n",
      " passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was\r\n",
      "settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was\r\n",

      "year and a half has passed since his crime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\r\n",
      "exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor\r\n",
      "misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\r\n",
      "the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the\r\n",
      "secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\r\n",
      "was found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he\r\n",

      "to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\r\n",
      "and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\r\n",
      "gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\r\n",
      "Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.\r\n",
      "The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\r\n",
      "judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\r\n",
      "had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\r\n",
      "use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\r\n",
      "trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\r\n",
      "never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\r\n",
      "incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\r\n",
      "seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\r\n",
      "some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\r\n",
      "damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\r\n",
      "should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\r\n",
      "a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\r\n",
      "more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\r\n",
      "not looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he\r\n",
      "hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\r\n",
      "the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\r\n",
      "derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\r\n",
      "gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\r\n",
      "insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\r\n",
      "Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\r\n",
      "All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\r\n",
      "quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\r\n",
      "element in the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\r\n",
      "criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\r\n",
      "as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\r\n",
      "answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\r\n",
      "his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\r\n",
      "provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\r\n",
      "roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\r\n",
      "through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\r\n",
      "privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\r\n",
      "answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\r\n",
      "coarse....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\r\n",
      "perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\r\n",
      "but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\r\n",
      "and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\r\n",
      "There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\r\n",
      "of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\r\n",
      "had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\r\n",
      "abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\r\n",
      "murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\r\n",
      "commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\r\n",
      "confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\r\n",
      "the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\r\n",
      "and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\r\n",
      "suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\r\n",
      "much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s\r\n",
      "favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\r\n",
      "proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\r\n",
      "consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\r\n",
      "him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\r\n",
      "old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\r\n",
      "when he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\r\n",
      "had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\r\n",
      "little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\r\n",
      "investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\r\n",
      "made an impression in his favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\r\n",
      "circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a\r\n",
      "term of eight years only.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\r\n",
      "and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\r\n",
      "trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so\r\n",
      "as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\r\n",
      "to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\r\n",
      "illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\r\n",

      "reputation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\r\n",
      "asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\r\n",
      "contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she\r\n",
      "told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\r\n",
      "that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\r\n",
      "had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\r\n",
      "in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\r\n",
      "brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured\r\n",
      "Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\r\n",
      "article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was\r\n",
      "continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\r\n",
      "with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\r\n",
      "obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\r\n",
      "her suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange\r\n",
      "silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\r\n",
      "getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\r\n",
      "on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\r\n",
      "great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\r\n",
      "suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\r\n",
      "afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\r\n",
      "case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\r\n",
      "her faculties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\r\n",
      "such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\r\n",
      "without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\r\n",
      "suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\r\n",
      "lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\r\n",
      "her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\r\n",
      "silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\r\n",
      "the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her\r\n",
      "brother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\r\n",
      "sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\r\n",
      "fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\r\n",
      "Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\r\n",
      "succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\r\n",
      "begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\r\n",
      "future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,\r\n",
      "pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\r\n",
      "but she still went on talking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin\r\n",
      "and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last\r\n",
      "the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\r\n",
      "separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\r\n",
      "his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\r\n",
      "of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\r\n",
      "up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great\r\n",

      "so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his\r\n",

      "passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\r\n",
      "would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\r\n",

      "together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their\r\n",

      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\r\n",
      "marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\r\n",
      "melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\r\n",
      "and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\r\n",
      "little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\r\n",

      "continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\r\n",
      "strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public\r\n",
      "conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\r\n",
      "begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\r\n",
      "student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did\r\n",

      "and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\r\n",

      "on going to see her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes\r\n",
      "begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One\r\n",
      "morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\r\n",
      "that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\r\n",

      "began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\r\n",
      "put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\r\n",
      "helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual\r\n",
      "fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\n",
      "taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.\r\n",
      "It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she\r\n",

      "first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\r\n",
      "they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\r\n",
      "from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\r\n",
      "brother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\r\n",
      "detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no\r\n",
      "conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of\r\n",
      "any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\r\n",
      "simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\r\n",
      "what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\r\n",
      "and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The\r\n",
      "picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\r\n",

      "facts.\r\n",

      "of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\r\n",

      "he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\r\n",
      "from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\r\n",
      "that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\r\n",
      "had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\r\n",
      "seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\r\n",
      "had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\r\n",
      "work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\r\n",
      "about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that\r\n",
      "at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\r\n",
      "his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\r\n",
      "declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote\r\n",
      "further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\r\n",
      "had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\r\n",
      "crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\r\n",
      "rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\r\n",
      "he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\r\n",
      "from inattention and indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\r\n",
      "had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\r\n",
      "rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\r\n",
      "almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\r\n",
      "she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\r\n",
      "on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\r\n",

      "was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\r\n",
      "indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the\r\n",

      "that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!\r\n",

      "conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\r\n",
      "a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just\r\n",
      "because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\r\n",
      "through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\r\n",

      "Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a\r\n",

      "Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\r\n",

      "the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future\r\n",
      "resurrection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he\r\n",
      "could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at\r\n",
      "his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and\r\n",
      "prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in\r\n",
      "prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of\r\n",

      "a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away\r\n",
      "in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and\r\n",
      "longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not\r\n",
      "want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome\r\n",
      "and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that\r\n",
      "surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much\r\n",
      "that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\r\n",
      "the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\r\n",
      "seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\r\n",
      "him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\r\n",
      "isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\r\n",
      "were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\r\n",
      "prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as\r\n",
      "ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.\r\n",
      "He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the\r\n",
      "Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former\r\n",
      "officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.\r\n",
      "He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at\r\n",
      "last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised\r\n",

      "The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his\r\n",

      "him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;\r\n",
      "his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard\r\n",

      "everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,\r\n",
      "knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no\r\n",
      "particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents\r\n",
      "of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between\r\n",
      "them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their\r\n",
      "relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their\r\n",
      "instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they\r\n",
      "all took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you\r\n",
      "are our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that\r\n",
      "frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was\r\n",
      "delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round\r\n",
      "to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in\r\n",
      "fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her\r\n",

      "He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\r\n",
      "he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\r\n",
      "and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\r\n",
      "terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\r\n",
      "Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\r\n",
      "of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\r\n",
      "endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\r\n",
      "mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\r\n",
      "and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\r\n",
      "had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\r\n",
      "moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\r\n",
      "went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\r\n",
      "one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\r\n",
      "looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\r\n",
      "his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\r\n",
      "consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\r\n",
      "to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\r\n",
      "gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\r\n",
      "the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\r\n",
      "and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\r\n",
      "and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\r\n",
      "the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\r\n",
      "summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\r\n",
      "because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\r\n",
      "could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\r\n",
      "on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\r\n",
      "quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\r\n",
      "fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\r\n",
      "men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\r\n",
      "moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\r\n",
      "world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\r\n",
      "a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\r\n",
      "men, no one had heard their words and their voices.\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\r\n",
      "miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\r\n",
      "The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\r\n",
      "days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\r\n",
      "paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\r\n",
      "his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\r\n",
      "difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\r\n",
      "in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\r\n",
      "windows of the ward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\r\n",
      "waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\r\n",
      "distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\r\n",
      "Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\r\n",
      "moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\r\n",
      "after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\r\n",
      "discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\r\n",
      "moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\r\n",

      "differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\r\n",

      "think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\r\n",
      "analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\r\n",

      "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\n",
      "low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\n",
      "the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very\n",
      "large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,\n",
      "that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only\n",
      "by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\n",
      "careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\n",
      "understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades\n",
      "and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young\n",
      "artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to\n",
      "delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest\n",
      "contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by\n",

      "portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\n",
      "picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\n",
      "nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\n",
      "drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\n",
      "half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\n",

      "alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a\n",

      "plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic\n",
      "fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n",

      "In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\n",
      "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\n",

      "Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\n",
      "there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\n",

      "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\n",
      "array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with\n",
      "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\n",
      "of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\n",
      "round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\n",
      "mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous\n",
      "cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such\n",
      "a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old\n",
      "whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were\n",
      "storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,\n",
      "fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a\n",
      "sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was\n",
      "flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards\n",
      "slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the\n",

      "coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,\n",
      "ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws\n",
      "of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed\n",

      "each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\n",
      "jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\n",
      "frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not\n",
      "only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\n",

      "\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\n",

      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\n",

      "\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\n",

      "your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\n",
      "sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\n",
      "to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\n",
      "down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\n",

      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\n",

      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\n",
      "the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\n",
      "mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",
      "kill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\n",
      "me in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\n",
      "Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\n",
      "the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\n",
      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\n",
      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",
      "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\n",
      "say--I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\n",

      "The Counterpane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\n",

      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\n",

      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\n",

      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",

      "I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",

      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\n",

      "I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\n",
      "robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back\n",
      "upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\n",
      "congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\n",
      "chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\n",
      "whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a\n",
      "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n",
      "dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\n",
      "Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\n",
      "of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\n",
      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\n",
      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\n",
      "noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\n",
      "ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the\n",
      "clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\n",
      "fiddle-headed beak.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\n",
      "earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\n",
      "leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is\n",
      "first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From\n",
      "thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\n",
      "favourable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not\n",

      "down upon the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last\n",

      "fish to swallow up Jonah.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is\n",
      "one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.\n",
      "Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a\n",
      "pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that\n",
      "canticle in the fish's belly!  How billow-like and boisterously\n",
      "grand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the\n",
      "kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is\n",
      "about us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\n",
      "Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful\n",
      "men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,\n",
      "it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,\n",
      "hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,\n",
      "repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.\n",
      "As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in\n",
      "his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what\n",
      "that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.\n",
      "But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to\n",
      "do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors\n",
      "to persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it\n",
      "is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God\n",
      "consists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\n",
      "God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men\n",
      "will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\n",
      "Captains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and\n",
      "seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a\n",
      "hitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have\n",
      "been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of\n",
      "learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as\n",
      "far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in\n",
      "those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\n",
      "Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly\n",
      "coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more\n",
      "than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the\n",
      "Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought\n",
      "to flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible\n",
      "and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking\n",
      "from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar\n",
      "hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his\n",
      "look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere\n",
      "suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a\n",
      "deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,\n",
      "valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with\n",
      "their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the\n",
      "Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps\n",
      "on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\n",
      "moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil\n",
      "eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\n",
      "confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of\n",
      "the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome\n",

      "a widow;\" or, \"Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry\n",
      "lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or\n",

      "the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the\n",
      "apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his\n",
      "person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\n",
      "sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\n",
      "hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\n",
      "boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will\n",
      "not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.\n",
      "So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be\n",
      "the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into\n",
      "the cabin.\n",

      "out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless\n",

      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\n",
      "and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\n",
      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\n",

      "crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially\n",
      "as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our\n",

      "other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a\n",
      "gallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the\n",
      "time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague\n",
      "misgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\n",

      "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\n",
      "postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\n",

      "concluded repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that about Cods, ma'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\n",

      "\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\"\n",

      "friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely\n",
      "bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted\n",

      "leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod\n",
      "announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to\n",
      "the kitchen door, I uttered the word \"cod\" with great emphasis, and\n",

      "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had\n",
      "been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little\n",

      "insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\n",
      "the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\n",
      "instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\n",
      "the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\n",
      "befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\n",
      "vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\n",
      "upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\n",
      "that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\n",
      "irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\n",
      "great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising\n",
      "forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\n",
      "rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\n",
      "whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the\n",

      "little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best\n",
      "fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my\n",
      "remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\n",
      "acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\n",
      "determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\n",
      "settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\n",
      "Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\n",
      "it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\n",
      "and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could\n",
      "find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\n",

      "then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\n",

      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\n",
      "claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\n",
      "vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\n",
      "owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\n",
      "Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\n",
      "tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\n",
      "long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\n",
      "holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\n",
      "somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.\n",

      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\n",
      "at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\n",
      "of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\n",
      "of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\n",
      "hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\n",

      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\n",
      "of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\n",
      "a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
      "constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance\n",
      "of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old\n",
      "seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker\n",
      "style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\n",
      "minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\n",
      "pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n",

      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\n",

      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\n",

      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\n",

      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\n",
      "for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\n",
      "least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\n",
      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\n",
      "might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\n",
      "a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\n",
      "out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which\n",
      "I would not have to pay one stiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\n",
      "those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\n",
      "content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\n",
      "putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\n",
      "have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\n",
      "of a broad-shouldered make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\n",
      "deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\n",
      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\n",
      "Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\n",
      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\n",
      "where moth--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust\n",
      "do corrupt, but LAY--'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\n",
      "than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\n",
      "at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\n",
      "the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\n",
      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\n",
      "labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\n",
      "widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\n",
      "Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
      "cabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\n",
      "these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\n",
      "would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\n",
      "round Cape Horn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\n",
      "foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\n",
      "ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature\n",
      "that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\n",
      "to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a\n",
      "live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\n",
      "canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n",
      "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\n",
      "he whistled at last--\"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\n",
      "Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\n",
      "will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank\n",
      "ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye\n",
      "say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\n",
      "lay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\n",
      "I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\n",
      "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\n",
      "the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n",
      "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\n",
      "thou art shipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",
      "they not lick his blood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\n",
      "sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\n",
      "utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if\n",
      "he be, Ahab has his humanities!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\n",
      "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\n",
      "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the\n",
      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n",

      "As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue\n",
      "all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for\n",
      "I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious\n",
      "obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my\n",
      "heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a\n",
      "toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,\n",
      "who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,\n",
      "bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on\n",
      "account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his\n",
      "name.\n",

      "I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\n",
      "things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\n",
      "pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\n",
      "subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\n",
      "absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?\n",
      "Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to\n",
      "be content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would\n",
      "not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us\n",
      "all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow\n",
      "dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\n",
      "rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\n",
      "but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n",
      "\"Queequeg,\" said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  \"I say,\n",
      "Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael.\"  But all remained\n",
      "still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such\n",
      "abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I\n",
      "looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner\n",
      "of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister\n",
      "one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line\n",
      "of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting\n",
      "against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the\n",
      "landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting\n",
      "to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since\n",
      "the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without\n",
      "it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still.  Something must have happened.\n",
      "Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly\n",
      "resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the\n",
      "first person I met--the chamber-maid.  \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I\n",
      "thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after\n",
      "breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and\n",
      "it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had\n",
      "both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,\n",
      "ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"--and with these\n",
      "cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\n",
      "vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\n",
      "occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black\n",
      "boy meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and\n",
      "fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a\n",
      "stroke; depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\n",
      "up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the\n",
      "mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\n",
      "countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter with you, young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\n",
      "pry it open!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the\n",
      "vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you\n",
      "talking about prying open any of my doors?\"--and with that she seized\n",
      "my arm.  \"What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,\n",
      "shipmate?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\n",
      "the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side\n",
      "of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No!  I\n",
      "haven't seen it since I put it there.\"  Running to a little closet\n",
      "under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told\n",
      "me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  \"He's killed himself,\" she\n",
      "cried.  \"It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another\n",
      "counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my\n",
      "house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,\n",

      "\n",
      "And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\n",
      "open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the\n",

      "her hand in her side-pocket, \"here's a key that'll fit, I guess;\n",
      "let's see.\"  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!\n",
      "Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have to burst it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a\n",
      "little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again\n",
      "vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and\n",
      "with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\n",
      "against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\n",
      "heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;\n",
      "right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding\n",
      "Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other\n",
      "way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Queequeg,\" said I, going up to him, \"Queequeg, what's the matter\n",
      "with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?\" said the landlady.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\n",
      "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was\n",
      "almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally\n",
      "constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so\n",
      "for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular\n",
      "meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Hussey,\" said I, \"he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you\n",
      "please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\n",
      "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he\n",
      "could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move\n",
      "a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my\n",
      "presence in the slightest way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;\n",
      "do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be\n",
      "so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him\n",
      "rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for\n",
      "ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't\n",
      "believe it's very punctual then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the\n",
      "long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding\n",
      "voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a\n",
      "schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic\n",
      "Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly\n",
      "eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\n",
      "this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\n",
      "termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\n",
      "not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\n",
      "downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half\n",
      "the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\n",
      "have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.\"\n",
      "But not a word did he reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\n",
      "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous\n",
      "to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over\n",
      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\n",
      "really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\n",
      "with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable\n",
      "Ramadan!\n",
      "\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's\n",
      "religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or\n",
      "insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it\n",
      "also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\n",
      "positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\n",
      "uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that\n",
      "individual aside and argue the point with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into\n",
      "bed now, and lie and listen to me.\"  I then went on, beginning with\n",
      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\n",
      "the various religions of the present time, during which time I\n",
      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\n",
      "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\n",
      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\n",
      "short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\n",
      "too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\n",
      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\n",
      "and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\n",
      "This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\n",
      "melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\n",
      "undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\n",
      "hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
      "in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\n",
      "o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\n",
      "turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\n",
      "such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical\n",
      "pagan piety.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\n",
      "hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady\n",
      "should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out\n",

      "before the Grand Jury.\"  And with these cracked words he finally\n",
      "departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his\n",
      "frantic impudence.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in\n",
      "profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked\n",
      "within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\n",
      "Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle\n",
      "open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger\n",
      "there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole\n",
      "length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\n",
      "arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said\n",
      "I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the\n",
      "wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\n",
      "would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\n",
      "matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.\n",
      "But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly\n",
      "hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;\n",
      "telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon\n",
      "the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and\n",
      "then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I.\n",

      "him face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent countenance\n",
      "then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,\n",
      "Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get\n",
      "off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't\n",
      "wake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\n",
      "lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe\n",
      "passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon\n",
      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,\n",
      "perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\n",
      "tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\n",
      "sleeper's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that for, Queequeg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\n",
      "which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and\n",
      "soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping\n",
      "rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,\n",
      "it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;\n",
      "then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab\n",

      "as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no\n",
      "sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.\n",
      "But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary\n",
      "in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\n",
      "Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;\n",
      "and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,\n",
      "Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;\n",
      "especially as in the merchant service many captains never show\n",
      "themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the\n",

      "good with the pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\n",

      "\n",

      "at the main-mast.  \"Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,\n",

      "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the\n",
      "pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with\n",
      "Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the\n",
      "licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself\n",
      "made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the\n",
      "ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other\n",
      "craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking\n",
      "over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing\n",
      "what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the\n",
      "windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in\n",
      "Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days\n",

      "\n",
      "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\n",
      "and swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he\n",
      "would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily\n",
      "I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking\n",
      "of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a\n",
      "devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the\n",
      "thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of\n",
      "his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp\n",
      "poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition\n",
      "of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate\n",
      "vicinity.  That was my first kick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared.\n",

      "saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg\n",
      "very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his\n",

      "there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;\n",

      "more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath\n",
      "to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to\n",
      "him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious\n",
      "strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word\n",
      "there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the\n",
      "wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern\n",
      "Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and\n",
      "left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically\n",
      "coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the\n",
      "hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically\n",
      "in his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can\n",
      "stand it; yes, I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\n",
      "his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\" murmured old\n",

      "that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all\n",
      "he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.\n",
      "Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly,\n",

      "rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n",
      "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n",
      "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n",
      "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n",
      "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\n",
      "inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\n",
      "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",

      "the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\n",

      "seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage\n",

      "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\n",
      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\n",
      "organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\n",
      "had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\n",

      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\n",

      "when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\n",
      "consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\n",
      "robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\n",

      "Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\n",
      "down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\n",

      "tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\n",
      "and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\n",

      "especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head\n",
      "Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\n",
      "full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\n",
      "came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\n",
      "elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\n",

      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\n",
      "of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\n",
      "cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\n",
      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\n",
      "the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\n",
      "nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were\n",

      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

      "barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send\n",

      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\n",
      "they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\n",

      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\n",
      "class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\n",
      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\n",
      "are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\n",
      "their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly\n",
      "communicating with it.\n",

      "generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family\n",
      "these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for\n",
      "all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck\n",

      "many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\n",
      "parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in\n",
      "any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if\n",
      "he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\n",
      "given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only\n",
      "homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though\n",
      "he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping\n",
      "upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to\n",
      "peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be\n",
      "detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of\n",
      "condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was\n",
      "by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\n",
      "those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\n",
      "incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\n",
      "they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism\n",
      "of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained\n",
      "unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\n",
      "incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's\n",
      "intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the\n",
      "practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of\n",
      "some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,\n",
      "more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's\n",
      "true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the\n",
      "highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous\n",
      "more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful\n",
      "of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over\n",
      "the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small\n",
      "things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some\n",
      "royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.\n",
      "But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of\n",
      "geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian\n",
      "herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will\n",

      "latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that\n",
      "daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete\n",
      "inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\n",
      "heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,\n",
      "he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\n",
      "saying, \"Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,\n",
      "the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\n",
      "Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the\n",
      "planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some\n",
      "touch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle.\n",
      "The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly\n",
      "shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with\n",
      "that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a\n",
      "rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
      "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",
      "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off\n",
      "his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\n",
      "right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,\n",
      "pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down\n",
      "rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\n",
      "reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\n",
      "But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new\n",
      "face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask\n",
      "enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the\n",
      "Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n",
      "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\n",
      "some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\n",

      "very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in\n",
      "that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not\n",
      "to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head\n",
      "of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore\n",
      "this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,\n",
      "King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\n",
      "courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\n",
      "grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit\n",
      "presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that\n",
      "man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the\n",
      "time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for\n",
      "Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,\n",
      "has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social\n",
      "czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this\n",
      "consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,\n",
      "then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of\n",
      "sea-life just mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\n",
      "sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but\n",
      "still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited\n",
      "to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in\n",
      "Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With\n",
      "one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as\n",
      "he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the\n",
      "world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\n",
      "observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And\n",
      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\n",
      "circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where\n",
      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\n",
      "only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\n",
      "when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\n",
      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\n",
      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\n",
      "it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\n",
      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\n",
      "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\n",
      "was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\n",
      "it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\n",
      "Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\n",
      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\n",
      "relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and\n",
      "satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.\n",
      "I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\n",
      "beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.\n",
      "There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\n",
      "there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere\n",
      "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\n",
      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\n",
      "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\n",
      "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\n",
      "awful Ahab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\n",
      "table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in\n",
      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\n",
      "rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And\n",
      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\n",
      "residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of\n",
      "the high and mighty cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire\n",
      "care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\n",
      "inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,\n",
      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\n",
      "harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\n",
      "report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\n",
      "Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites\n",
      "had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the\n",
      "previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\n",
      "great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\n",
      "And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\n",
      "hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\n",
      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\n",
      "them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\n",
      "at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\n",
      "in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\n",
      "his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\n",
      "to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\n",
      "jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",

      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",

      "truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be\n",
      "said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did\n",
      "enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning\n",
      "inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\n",
      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\n",
      "hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was\n",
      "inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of\n",
      "Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as\n",

      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\n",

      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",

      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\n",

      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",

      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\n",

      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",

      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\n",

      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\n",
      "yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and\n",
      "with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\n",
      "escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\n",
      "at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\n",
      "For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\n",
      "hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\n",
      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\n",
      "again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\n",
      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\n",
      "soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\n",
      "purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against\n",
      "gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its\n",

      "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\n",
      "receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\n",
      "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\n",
      "the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\n",

      "nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,\n",
      "poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to\n",
      "wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he\n",
      "had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice\n",
      "circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\n",
      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\n",
      "together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\n",
      "known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw\n",
      "the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons\n",
      "with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead\n",

      "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however\n",

      "memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean\n",
      "has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such\n",
      "a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to\n",
      "his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for\n",
      "however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon\n",
      "put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down\n",
      "into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from\n",
      "the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige\n",
      "of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo\n",

      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n",

      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\n",

      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\n",

      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\n",
      "minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\n",
      "illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you\n",
      "will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\n",
      "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\n",
      "these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\n",

      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\n",
      "easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\n",
      "whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will\n",
      "tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\n",
      "been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\n",
      "connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n",
      "and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\n",
      "place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations\n",
      "have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\n",
      "isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\n",
      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\n",
      "of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",
      "substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\n",
      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",
      "according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\n",
      "half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\n",

      "It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\n",

      "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\n",
      "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\n",
      "brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n",
      "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n",
      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n",
      "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\n",
      "terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\n",
      "background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted\n",

      "Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion\n",
      "mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are\n",
      "evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the\n",
      "manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the\n",
      "White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\n",
      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\n",
      "knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\n",
      "chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,\n",

      "whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off\n",
      "lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more\n",
      "natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not\n",
      "only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\n",
      "sociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of\n",
      "course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\n",

      "Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\n",

      "superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean\n",

      "collectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in\n",

      "midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though\n",
      "an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;\n",
      "as much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in\n",
      "his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to\n",
      "nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed\n",
      "our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite\n",
      "as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh\n",
      "from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this\n",
      "Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a\n",
      "mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible\n",
      "firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition\n",
      "which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had\n",
      "long been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved\n",
      "so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\n",
      "prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again\n",
      "increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\n",
      "every day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like\n",
      "our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping\n",
      "their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should\n",
      "the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,\n",
      "the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\n",
      "remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\n",
      "Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\n",
      "gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at\n",
      "their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable\n",
      "length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if\n",
      "any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a\n",
      "leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,\n",
      "some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a\n",
      "little anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was\n",
      "found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern\n",
      "manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.\n",
      "He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,\n",
      "and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,\n",
      "was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of\n",
      "nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,\n",
      "unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently\n",
      "imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about\n",
      "the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only\n",
      "on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were\n",
      "working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\n",
      "gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\n",
      "continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\n",
      "mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across\n",
      "the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee\n",
      "scupper-holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this\n",
      "conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person\n",
      "placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very\n",
      "significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway\n",
      "against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and\n",
      "bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize\n",
      "that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be\n",
      "this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt\n",
      "was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing\n",
      "golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's\n",
      "snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,\n",
      "gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son\n",
      "to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;\n",
      "yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,\n",
      "and Steelkilt knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\n",
      "rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on\n",
      "with his gay banterings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n",
      "one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!\n",
      "I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had\n",
      "best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,\n",
      "boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a\n",
      "gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and\n",
      "the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at\n",
      "the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here\n",
      "now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing\n",
      "the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old\n",
      "soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his\n",
      "property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a\n",
      "poor devil like me the model of his nose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,\n",
      "pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at\n",
      "it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,\n",
      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\n",
      "tension of life's utmost energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\n",
      "went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his\n",
      "face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from\n",
      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\n",
      "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\n",
      "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\n",
      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\n",
      "as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\n",
      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\n",
      "valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\n",
      "gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\n",
      "sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\n",
      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\n",
      "unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the\n",
      "still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he\n",
      "had snatched from a cask near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,\n",
      "for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating\n",
      "Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow\n",
      "still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\n",
      "remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed\n",
      "Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\n",
      "commanding him to do his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",
      "his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\n",
      "the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking\n",
      "him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
      "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\n",
      "where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\n",
      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\n",
      "Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\n",
      "it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek\n",
      "he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been\n",
      "branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer\n",
      "touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was\n",
      "stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\n",
      "leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whale-ships in our\n",

      "lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it\n",
      "had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was\n",

      "and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into\n",
      "the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the\n",
      "spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\n",
      "seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale\n",
      "rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his\n",

      "Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\n",
      "there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\n",
      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\n",
      "department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\n",
      "form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\n",
      "this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\n",
      "tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It\n",
      "looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms\n",
      "of the true whale's majestic flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\n",
      "painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\n",
      "antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing\n",
      "Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the\n",
      "model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in\n",
      "painting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one\n",
      "whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\n",
      "undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\n",
      "a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\n",
      "which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate\n",
      "leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\n",
      "Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\n",
      "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\n",
      "What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding\n",
      "like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\n",
      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\n",
      "universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\n",
      "comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\n",
      "species of the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\n",
      "will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\n",
      "manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\n",
      "Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the\n",
      "title-page of the original edition of the \"Advancement of Learning\"\n",
      "you will find some curious whales.\n",

      "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at\n",
      "those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific\n",
      "delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of\n",
      "voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book\n",
      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\n",
      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\n",
      "Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\"  In this book is an outline purporting\n",
      "to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\n",
      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\n",
      "deck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\n",
      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\n",
      "of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant\n",
      "captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\n",
      "of mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\"\n",
      "In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\n",
      "alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\n",
      "but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\n",
      "for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\n",
      "this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\n",
      "upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All\n",
      "these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\n",
      "Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\n",
      "long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\n",
      "its counterpart in nature.\n",

      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\n",
      "Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which\n",
      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\n",

      "summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm\n",
      "Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had\n",
      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\n",
      "of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and\n",
      "saucers inform us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\n",
      "shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally\n",
      "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\n",

      "of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\n",
      "paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\n",
      "then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\n",
      "Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\n",
      "library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\n",
      "burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other\n",
      "leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\n",
      "inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the\n",
      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\n",
      "be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\n",
      "side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n",
      "human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\n",
      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\n",
      "these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be\n",
      "truly said to handle us without mittens.\"\n",

      "may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\n",
      "any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\n",

      "\n",
      "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\n",

      "the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the\n",
      "worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,\n",
      "cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or layers of\n",
      "concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the \"heart,\" or\n",

      "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n",

      "shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the\n",
      "other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\n",
      "consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\n",
      "safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\n",
      "to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\n",
      "almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\n",

      "\n",
      "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
      "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting\n",
      "crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs\n",

      "they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks\n",
      "or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden\n",
      "pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping\n",

      "out of your clutch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wet the line! wet the line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\n",

      "ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion\n",
      "from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking\n",
      "craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they\n",

      "towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\n",
      "yet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,\n",
      "Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart\n",

      "alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,\n",
      "and then ranging up for another fling.\n",

      "slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back\n",

      "agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\n",
      "after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,\n",
      "hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb\n",
      "straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the\n",

      "churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,\n",
      "carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel\n",
      "after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which\n",
      "he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold\n",
      "watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is\n",
      "struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing\n",
      "called his \"flurry,\" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,\n",
      "overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the\n",

      "that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\n",

      "float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other\n",
      "end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\n",
      "made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\n",
      "girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and\n",

      "so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the\n",
      "history and philosophy of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\n",
      "Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\n",
      "prices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of\n",
      "the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce\n",
      "to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a\n",
      "species of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine\n",
      "eating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\n",
      "balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for\n",
      "turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very\n",
      "fond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\n",
      "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\n",
      "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\n",
      "long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men\n",
      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\n",
      "not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have\n",
      "rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their\n",
      "most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\n",
      "being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that\n",
      "certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland\n",
      "by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months\n",
      "on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after\n",
      "trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are\n",
      "called \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\n",
      "and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'\n",
      "dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look\n",
      "that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\n",
      "exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to\n",
      "be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating\n",
      "as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a\n",
      "solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and\n",
      "creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a\n",
      "cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply\n",
      "a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method\n",
      "of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.\n",
      "In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the\n",

      "two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two\n",
      "large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a\n",
      "most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,\n",
      "which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that\n",

      "insanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the\n",
      "archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He\n",

      "came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The\n",
      "consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or\n",
      "nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken\n",
      "out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,\n",
      "as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but\n",
      "according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,\n",
      "cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his\n",
      "instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\n",

      "Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,\n",
      "and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than\n",
      "his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\n",

      "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon\n",
      "speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\n",
      "existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking\n",
      "in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\n",
      "attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his\n",
      "gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being\n",
      "than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But\n",
      "when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\n",
      "the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter\n",
      "him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\n",
      "opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and\n",
      "forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\n",
      "With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\n",
      "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\n",
      "iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\n",
      "was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies\n",
      "of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,\n",
      "while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with\n",
      "all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild\n",
      "exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for\n",
      "his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\n",
      "bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\n",
      "furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\n",
      "in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\n",
      "yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any\n",

      "Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\n",
      "oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\n",
      "the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.\n",
      "But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances\n",

      "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\n",
      "descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--\"The vial! the\n",
      "vial!\"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further\n",
      "hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with\n",
      "added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\n",
      "specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\n",
      "prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit\n",

      "received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.\n",
      "\n",

      "letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab.  \"Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's\n",
      "but a dim scrawl;--what's this?\"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck\n",
      "took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the\n",
      "end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the\n",
      "boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.\n",
      "\n",

      "rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,\n",

      "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\n",
      "there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now\n",
      "hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There\n",
      "is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time\n",
      "everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him\n",
      "who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our\n",
      "way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\n",
      "the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original\n",
      "hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and\n",
      "weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was\n",
      "inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,\n",
      "as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special\n",
      "purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require\n",
      "that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing\n",
      "or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies\n",
      "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n",
      "upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n",
      "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n",
      "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On\n",
      "the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a\n",
      "shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to\n",
      "uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as\n",
      "will presently be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\n",
      "bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful\n",
      "duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon\n",
      "the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a\n",
      "dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did\n",
      "I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called\n",
      "in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas\n",
      "belted round his waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we\n",
      "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at\n",
      "both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my\n",
      "narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the\n",
      "time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,\n",
      "then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,\n",
      "it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese\n",
      "ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;\n",
      "nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the\n",
      "hempen bond entailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\n",
      "that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\n",
      "perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\n",
      "company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and\n",
      "that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into\n",
      "unmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort\n",
      "of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could\n",
      "have so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I\n",
      "jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would\n",
      "threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this\n",

      "breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese\n",
      "connexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,\n",

      "pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you\n",
      "may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of\n",
      "life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\n",
      "sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.\n",

      "upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly\n",
      "allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the\n",

      "then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of\n",

      "another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\n",
      "Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\n",
      "keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they\n",

      "disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best\n",
      "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\n",
      "the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\n",
      "hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\n",
      "would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I\n",

      "\"Ha! ha!\" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging\n",

      "side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;\n",
      "then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and\n",
      "upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that\n",
      "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\n",
      "knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\n",
      "trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and\n",
      "toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\n",
      "trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the\n",

      "fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,\n",
      "leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double\n",
      "welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than\n",
      "the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But\n",
      "the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present\n",

      "If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\n",
      "of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\n",
      "resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and\n",
      "from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull\n",
      "(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,\n",
      "and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the\n",
      "depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you\n",
      "would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by\n",

      "But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,\n",
      "you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have\n",
      "another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any\n",
      "quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its\n",
      "vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing\n",
      "rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,\n",
      "that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the\n",
      "curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the\n",
      "first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,\n",
      "in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of\n",
      "which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow\n",
      "of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an\n",
      "important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\n",
      "cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a\n",
      "man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would\n",
      "rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin\n",
      "joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice\n",
      "in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I\n",
      "fling half out to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His\n",
      "cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in\n",
      "that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches\n",
      "across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the\n",
      "base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the\n",
      "canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\n",
      "large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the\n",
      "same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and\n",
      "directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for\n",
      "many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord\n",
      "remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.\n",
      "Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and\n",
      "map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this\n",
      "light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\n",
      "more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his\n",
      "spinal cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\n",
      "would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to\n",
      "the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises\n",
      "over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,\n",
      "the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I\n",
      "should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness\n",
      "in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you\n",
      "will yet have reason to know.\n",

      "must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\n",
      "muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\n",

      "foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\n",
      "doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\n",
      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\n",
      "an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\n",
      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\n",

      "imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\n",
      "Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a\n",

      "are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\n",
      "the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the\n",
      "reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to\n",
      "a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A\n",

      "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\n",
      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",
      "represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity\n",

      "fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his\n",

      "answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\n",
      "consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily\n",
      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\n",
      "in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would\n",
      "accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",
      "players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\n",
      "hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\n",

      "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n",

      "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.\n",
      "But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\n",
      "exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\n",
      "body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\n",
      "campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\n",
      "Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\n",
      "when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\n",
      "effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\n",
      "whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n",

      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\n",
      "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or\n",
      "a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\n",
      "surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\n",
      "regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by\n",
      "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the\n",
      "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he\n",
      "cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\n",
      "attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\n",
      "beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n",
      "connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle\n",
      "alone; and this is on the top of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with\n",
      "the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not\n",
      "think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\n",
      "scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\n",
      "a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\n",
      "nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to\n",
      "say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,\n",
      "this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,\n",
      "by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\n",
      "drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle\n",
      "of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his\n",
      "ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n",
      "involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,\n",
      "when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated\n",
      "blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\n",
      "he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel\n",
      "crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\n",
      "future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact\n",
      "of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded\n",
      "upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\n",
      "consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in\n",
      "HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I\n",
      "mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\n",
      "will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\n",
      "other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\n",
      "seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\n",

      "told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.\n",
      "Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\n",
      "different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale\n",
      "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\n",
      "too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all\n",

      "furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\n",
      "retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\n",
      "whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\n",
      "strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what\n",
      "has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that\n",
      "had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out\n",

      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n",
      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\n",
      "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\n",
      "laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question\n",
      "returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\n",
      "whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\n",
      "breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\n",
      "at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\n",
      "that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\n",
      "it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n",
      "through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\n",
      "would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he\n",
      "cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very\n",
      "closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\n",
      "unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his\n",
      "jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak\n",
      "out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\n",
      "you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so\n",
      "easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain\n",
      "things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might\n",
      "almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\n",
      "enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls\n",
      "from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\n",
      "close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\n",
      "cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\n",
      "you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\n",
      "that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\n",
      "that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\n",
      "spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\n",
      "whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\n",
      "sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\n",
      "the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\n",
      "water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a\n",
      "cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\n",
      "the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be\n",
      "peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your\n",
      "pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even\n",
      "when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the\n",
      "jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from\n",
      "the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who\n",
      "coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\n",
      "scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin\n",
      "peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\n",
      "spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I\n",
      "have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is\n",

      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",

      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\n",
      "for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\n",

      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\n",

      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\n",
      "the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\n",
      "in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\n",
      "embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\n",
      "three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\n",
      "time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\n",
      "boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\n",
      "mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\n",
      "been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\n",
      "extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\n",
      "precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\n",
      "unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\n",
      "may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\n",
      "becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\n",
      "fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\n",
      "was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\n",
      "snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\n",
      "it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\n",
      "Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\n",
      "his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\n",
      "from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n",
      "shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\n",
      "while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\n",
      "if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\n",
      "mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\n",
      "reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\n",
      "towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in\n",
      "their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also\n",
      "seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from\n",
      "certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured\n",
      "some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a\n",
      "little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\n",
      "from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\n",
      "reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,\n",
      "the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate\n",
      "side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\n",
      "plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from\n",
      "foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!\n",

      "shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\n",
      "towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical\n",
      "cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still\n",
      "tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\n",
      "chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes\n",
      "entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.\n",
      "Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in\n",
      "this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\n",
      "unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\n",
      "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing\n",
      "but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to\n",
      "an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two\n",
      "teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the\n",
      "breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these\n",
      "precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the\n",
      "mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for\n",
      "rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it\n",
      "might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual\n",
      "esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations\n",
      "and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely\n",
      "and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely\n",
      "revelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed\n",

      "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\n",
      "spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\n",

      "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\n",
      "of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the\n",
      "sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to\n",
      "and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.\n",
      "It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly\n",
      "powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by\n",
      "sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting\n",
      "a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for\n",
      "hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in\n",
      "this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from\n",
      "the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in\n",

      "battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\n",
      "spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he\n",
      "seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at\n",
      "first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we\n",
      "perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,\n",
      "this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he\n",
      "had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free\n",
      "end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in\n",
      "the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade\n",
      "itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to\n",
      "madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing\n",
      "with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\n",
      "wounding and murdering his own comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\n",
      "stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\n",
      "began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted\n",
      "by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly\n",
      "to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries\n",
      "vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more\n",
      "central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long\n",
      "calm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then\n",
      "like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river\n",
      "Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling\n",
      "upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common\n",

      "rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\n",
      "After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided\n",
      "into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by\n",
      "random whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky\n",
      "salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,\n",
      "while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat\n",
      "taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing\n",

      "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\n",
      "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\n",
      "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\n",
      "onward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;\n",
      "but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\n",
      "whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which\n",
      "Flask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or\n",
      "three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional\n",
      "game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a\n",

      "prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.\n",

      "sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct\n",
      "bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,\n",
      "in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever\n",
      "turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun\n",
      "blasted whales in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\n",
      "recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\n",
      "knotted round the tail of one of these whales.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a pretty fellow, now,\" he banteringly laughed, standing in\n",
      "the ship's bows, \"there's a jackal for ye!  I well know that these\n",
      "Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes\n",
      "lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale\n",
      "spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold\n",
      "full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing\n",
      "that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's\n",
      "wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a\n",
      "Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I\n",
      "mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that\n",
      "other precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a\n",
      "hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear\n",
      "charity's sake.  For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale\n",
      "there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned\n",
      "cell.  And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by\n",
      "chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll get\n",
      "from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may\n",
      "contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I\n",
      "wonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It's worth trying.\n",
      "Yes, I'm for it;\" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that\n",
      "whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with\n",
      "no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from\n",
      "the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the\n",
      "stranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance\n",
      "with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was\n",
      "carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,\n",
      "and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;\n",
      "the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red\n",
      "colour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton\n",
      "de Rose,\"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name\n",
      "of this aromatic ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,\n",
      "yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\n",
      "sufficiently explained the whole to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A wooden rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that\n",
      "will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\n",
      "had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\n",
      "to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\n",
      "bawled--\"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses\n",
      "that speak English?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to\n",
      "be the chief-mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"WHAT whale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\n",
      "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\n",
      "hands into a trumpet and shouted--\"No, Sir!  No!\"  Upon which Ahab\n",
      "retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\n",
      "chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort\n",
      "of bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter with your nose, there?\" said Stubb.  \"Broke it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!\"\n",
      "answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was\n",
      "at very much.  \"But what are you holding YOURS for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,\n",
      "ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of\n",
      "posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the devil's name do you want here?\" roared the Guernseyman,\n",
      "flying into a sudden passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those\n",
      "whales in ice while you're working at 'em?  But joking aside, though;\n",
      "do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil\n",
      "out of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a\n",
      "gill in his whole carcase.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't\n",
      "believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\n",
      "before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't\n",
      "me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined\n",
      "Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer\n",
      "scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red\n",
      "worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.\n",
      "But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in\n",
      "anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from\n",
      "their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would\n",
      "drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\n",
      "Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,\n",
      "and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the\n",
      "stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\n",
      "puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\n",
      "olfactories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\n",
      "from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\n",
      "saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar\n",
      "from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n",
      "to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the\n",
      "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n",
      "indignations at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\n",
      "the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\n",
      "stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\n",
      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\n",
      "a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n",
      "ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\n",
      "was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\n",
      "cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he\n",
      "pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter\n",
      "any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\n",
      "with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\n",
      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\n",
      "was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\n",
      "ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\n",
      "\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\n",
      "to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from\n",
      "a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a\n",
      "baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
      "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\n",
      "conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\n",
      "somebody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down\n",
      "into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the\n",
      "interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;\n",
      "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\n",
      "Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\n",
      "these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\n",
      "hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line\n",
      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",
      "Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\n",
      "ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n",
      "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n",
      "while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon\n",
      "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\n",
      "give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\n",
      "his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\n",
      "an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\n",
      "almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\n",
      "when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\n",
      "turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\n",
      "His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\n",
      "chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\n",
      "beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\n",
      "increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\n",
      "there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\n",
      "of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\n",
      "into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\n",
      "a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\n",
      "with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\n",
      "this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
      "druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\n",
      "were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\n",
      "that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\n",
      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",
      "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n",
      "carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\n",
      "grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\n",
      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out\n",
      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\n",
      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\n",
      "were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\n",
      "that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\n",
      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\n",
      "And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\n",
      "that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of\n",
      "all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\n",
      "manufacturing stages, is the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\n",
      "slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\n",
      "is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\n",
      "thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\n",
      "did this odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n",
      "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\n",
      "rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\n",
      "be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\n",

      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",

      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",
      "traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\n",
      "was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\n",
      "cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\n",
      "Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\n",
      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\n",
      "Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\n",
      "how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\n",
      "No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in\n",
      "his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come\n",
      "up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\n",
      "considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\n",
      "timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\n",
      "instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\n",
      "invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\n",
      "same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
      "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
      "miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n",
      "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;\n",
      "such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his\n",
      "finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned\n",
      "entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,\n",
      "where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro\n",
      "before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\n",
      "hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile\n",
      "eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral\n",
      "insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal\n",
      "orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;\n",
      "and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity is\n",
      "heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at\n",

      "further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\n",

      "all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\n",
      "with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\n",

      "stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I\n",
      "faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into\n",
      "the wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful\n",

      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\n",

      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n",
      "to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\n",
      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\n",

      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\n",

      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\n",

      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\n",

      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\n",

      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\n",

      "with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was\n",
      "threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that\n",

      "constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him\n",
      "to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that\n",
      "what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.\n",
      "For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to\n",
      "terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,\n",
      "formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow\n",
      "jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,\n",
      "and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an\n",

      "way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into\n",
      "his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick\n",
      "enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the\n",
      "privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case\n",

      "not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for\n",

      "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\n",
      "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\n",
      "unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\n",
      "a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far\n",

      "\n",
      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\n",
      "fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\n",
      "something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular\n",
      "basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n",
      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\n",
      "all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\n",
      "were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for\n",
      "beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\n",
      "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton\n",
      "of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The\n",
      "largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\n",
      "part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the\n",
      "greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must\n",
      "have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib\n",
      "measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only\n",
      "conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that\n",
      "part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all\n",
      "that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\n",
      "muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\n",
      "saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and\n",
      "majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n",
      "\n",
      "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to\n",
      "try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over\n",
      "his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\n",
      "Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\n",
      "of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the\n",
      "fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\n",
      "crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But\n",
      "now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\n",
      "not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks\n",
      "on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The\n",
      "largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,\n",
      "and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers\n",
      "away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something\n",
      "like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller\n",
      "ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the\n",

      "along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\n",
      "also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\n",
      "fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth\n",
      "scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being\n",

      "breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\n",

      "leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but\n",
      "his composed countenance in view.  \"Rarmai\" (it will do; it is easy),\n",

      "During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.\n",
      "Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;\n",
      "soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,\n",
      "when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\n",
      "that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\n",
      "moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\n",
      "leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\n",
      "could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\n",
      "answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n",
      "unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\n",

      "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and\n",
      "civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months\n",
      "convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well\n",
      "again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at\n",
      "length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but\n",
      "eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\n",
      "threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned\n",
      "a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,\n",
      "and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\n",

      "Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\n",
      "grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\n",

      "prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had\n",
      "written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the\n",
      "earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that\n",

      "tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.\n",
      "Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will\n",
      "ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?\" holding it high\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\n",
      "hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\n",
      "socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and\n",
      "some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great\n",

      "so, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and\n",
      "rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily\n",
      "stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the\n",
      "sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.\n",
      "But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet\n",
      "most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy\n",

      "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\n",

      "aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between\n",
      "the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in\n",

      "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\n",
      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the\n",
      "whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",
      "spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\n",

      "stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\n",

      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\n",
      "if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",

      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\n",
